The unpleasantries and injustice of Pinochet's reign, in turn, prompted the efforts of a small, brave, tightly-knit cadre of rebels, known as the MIR, who banded together to buck the current regime and restore the paradise of Salvador Allende. On October 5, 1974, with MIR leader Miguel Enriquez murdered in combat, the Chilean secret police invaded the home of Enriquez's accomplice, Carmen Castillo, and wounded her - as a warning against future subversive activities. This represented only the beginning of a massive clamp-down against the Chilean underground resistance, that would see Pinochet prevail. Castillo's memories, however, lingered - and in time, she found herself asking key questions about the value of her and others' attempts at sedition, especially in light of the unfavorable outcome. The documentary Santa Fe Street finds exiled director Castillo undertaking a long and often poignant journey into the past to revisit the heroic anti-establishment efforts in which she participated. In the process, she ponders whether Enriquez and others died in vain, reinvestigates the events that carried her from 'underground subversive' to 'political exile,' and revisits the circumstances that tore a nation in half ideologically.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : calle santa fe.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.42 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1231 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 18.0 MiB\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1097 Kbps\n      Width : 592 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.183\n      StreamSize : 1.25 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 2h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 148 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nIMDB: tt1038904\n\nSpanish audio; Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of Brazilian DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11ab442ca70e77d582cb7718566b9f01b9ccf917","amp;dn":"Carmen+Castillo+-+Calle+Santa+Fe+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11ab442ca70e77d582cb7718566b9f01b9ccf917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,171,68,44,167,14,119,213,130,203,119,24,86,107,159,1,185,204,249,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
