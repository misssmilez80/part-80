Peter LaFleur doesn't want to lose his gym to Goodman, but can't find a way to get $50,000 in time. Peter and his gang of gym buddies think of ways to raise money, finally settling on winning a dodgeball tournament. White Goodman retaliates by creating his own dodgeball team to finish off Peter. Peter's team doesn't do too well, until legendary ADAA champ Patches O'Houlihan turns up ready to train them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0333adb0d340d500c9d96f323fed680ef0f5e4","amp;dn":"Dodgeball.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0333adb0d340d500c9d96f323fed680ef0f5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,3,51,173,176,211,64,213,0,201,217,111,50,63,237,104,14,240,245,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
