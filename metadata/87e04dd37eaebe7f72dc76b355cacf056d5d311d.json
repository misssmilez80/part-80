Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.\n\nRemember to only download Syfer Torrents from TheSyfer user accounts to avoid fakes.\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed (:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e04dd37eaebe7f72dc76b355cacf056d5d311d","amp;dn":"Pandorum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e04dd37eaebe7f72dc76b355cacf056d5d311d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,224,77,211,126,174,190,127,114,220,118,179,85,202,207,5,109,93,49,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
