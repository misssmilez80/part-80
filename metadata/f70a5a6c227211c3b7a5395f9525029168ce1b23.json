They decide to camp en route in a \ndesolate area of central Texas, where they witness a Satanic ritual human \nsacrifice. After barely escaping with their lives, they report the incident to \nthe local sheriff (R.G. Armstrong), who investigates their report but attempts \nto convince the men that they probably only saw hippies killing an animal. When \nthe men refuse to accept the sheriff\\\\\\'s explanation, it becomes clear that he is \na part of the Satanic cult. The couples agree to leave peacefully, but Roger \nsteals a sample of dirt stained with the murder victim\\\\\\'s blood, intent on \ndelivering it to the authorities in Amarillo. As the couples head towards \nAmarillo they are pursued by a steadily increasing number of cultists, who are \nnetworked throughout numerous small Texas towns. Eventually, Roger and Frank \npurchase a shotgun and stage a showdown with the cult members during a high \nspeed chase that pits their RV against a convoy of trucks. Frank and Roger kill \nor wound all of the attackers and escape, stopping to celebrate when they pick \nup a radio signal coming from Amarillo. In the middle of their celebration, the \ncouples hear chanting outside their RV and find themselves surrounded by cult \nmembers. The film ends as the cult lights a ring of fire around the vehicle, \ntrapping the couples inside.\n[edit] ProductionRace with the Devil was filmed on location in San Antonio, \nCastroville, Bandera and Leakey, Texas. Director Jack Starrett later claimed he \nhired actual Satanists to serve as cult-member extras, though he probably stated \nthis for publicity purposes.[1][2] Starrett directed the similar B-movie action \nfilm A Small Town in Texas the following year.[3]\n[edit] ReleaseThe film was released theatrically in the United States by 20th \nCentury Fox in June 1975.\nThe film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2005. This version \nis currently out of print.\nOn April 12, 2011 the film was released on DVD through Shout! Factory, packaged \nas a double feature with another Peter Fonda film, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry.\n[edit] Remakes announcedA remake was planned in 2005, written by Drew McWeeny \nand Scott Swan, with Chris Moore (of Project Greenlight fame) to serve as \ndirector.[4] Kevin Smith has said that Race With the Devil is a strong influence \non his film Red State, which is due to be released in October 2011.[5]\n[edit] TriviaThe film was also the basis for the Tamil language film Kazhugu \n(Eagle) which was released in 1981.\n[edit] References^ \\\\\\&quot;Internet Movie Database, Filming Locations for Race with \n  the Devil\\\\\\&quot;. imdb.com. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073600/locations.
