I had this up on isohunt, but now that its working on here, i'll put it here.\n\nThis is the HD version of Jason DeRulo's &quot;Whatcha Say&quot; video!  This is a really simple video, but thats doesn't make it bad at all.  Jason did a very good job with playing his part in the video, showing emotion of the song, and a little dancing.  He is gonna blow up big if he can produce songs like this one. \n\nCodec for video is H.264 @ ~1478kbps Reso: 1280x720 and codec for audio is AAC @ 123kbps 44100khz.  This was downloaded straight from YT, so no compression was induced other than what Jason's media managers did.  Very good quality :D  Hope you enjoy the video.  If you like this release, please leave comments and some positive feedback. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cbe507de37e6d9e0716d6fc49c49e960eea254e","amp;dn":"Jason+DeRulo+-+Whatcha+Say+%5BHD+720p%5D+%5Bballeron24z%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cbe507de37e6d9e0716d6fc49c49e960eea254e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,190,80,125,227,126,109,158,7,22,214,252,73,196,158,150,14,234,37,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
