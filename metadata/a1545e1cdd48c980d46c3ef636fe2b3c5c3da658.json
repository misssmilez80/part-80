On this episode of\n        True Life, you'll meet three young people desperate to get rid\n        of the tatts they feel prevent them from fulfilling their\n        potential.\n        Larry is now sober after years of abusing drugs.

Ali wants to\n        get the tattoo covered up but is learning that the process isn't\n        a simple one. Will Ali find a way to hide her ex's name -- or\n        will she be forced to live with this painful reminder of her\n        past?\n        Jayson's fiancee wants him to get his tattoos lasered off so he\n        can land a higher paying job. But Jason is terrified of the pain\n        involved and is having second thoughts. Can Jason endure this\n        excruciating process so he can build a more solid future with\n        his wife-to-be?\n        The mistakes of their past are indelibly inked on their bodies.\n        Will they find a way to wipe the slate clean?
