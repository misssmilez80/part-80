Bart, Lisa and Maggie play with an annoying toy, which makes Homer angry. Homer breaks the toy, but the family have a road accident.\n\nA mysterious person drags them out. When the family wakes-up, they discover that the mysterious person was Cletus. Cletus tells Homer about moonshine, and soon, Homer becomes judge of a moonshine competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa plays hide and seek with Cletus's daughters, but she hides too well and can't find her way back. She encounters three girls who are practicing Wiccans. They ask Lisa to join their coven, which she accepts after having discovered that they can't throw spells. But the three girls are arrested and put on trial because Ned Flanders called the police and Lisa becomes the principal witness.\n\nMany of the citizens become suddenly blind (including Skinner, Krusty, and Luann Van Houten). They blame the three girls and wish to drown them, but Lisa explains that the real culprits are Homer and his friends who threw moonshine in the water because they were scared to be arrested by the police. After this explanation, the girls are freed and Homer plays with the witch-drowning chair.\n\nPostscoring by longret\nXDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5804a66064a1a10d82555b3774d87a584cb983c2","amp;dn":"Simpsons+21+season+Rednecks+and+Broomsticks+RUS+Postscoring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5804a66064a1a10d82555b3774d87a584cb983c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,4,166,96,100,161,161,13,130,85,91,55,116,216,122,88,76,185,131,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
