Whatever the threat, your personal data remains securely protected against unauthorized access.\n\nEncrypt folders and disk partitions to prevent the theft of valuable data\nWith Kaspersky KryptoStorage, you can lock your valuable data away in digital containers, protected by the powerful AES-128 strong encryption algorithm. Kaspersky KryptoStorage prevents unauthorized access to your encrypted data.\nAdd new files to your digital containers at anytime and transfer them quickly and easily to removable storage media or other computers\n\nOnce you have created a digital container or an encrypted folder, you can add new files to it at any time you wish. You can copy or move the container itself to a removable storage device or another computer, or even send it via email.\n\nEncrypt data &quot;on the fly&quot; and retain full access to the encrypted data\nOnce you open the encrypted folder, disk or digital container using your password, you can confidently work with the encrypted data knowing that it is completely inaccessible to cybercriminals.\n\nRestrict access to your encrypted data and protect it from modification or deletion\nThe encrypted objects are password-protected, so no-one will be able to access or corrupt your data or delete the files you need. Your data is also safe from rogue encryption attacks designed to extort money from the user.\n\nPermanently delete files or folders from your computer\nA conventionally deleted file can easily be restored.
