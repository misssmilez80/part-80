Waters-directed fusion of A Christmas Carol with a traditional romantic comedy -- stars Matthew McConaughey as Connor Mead, a famous photographer and confirmed womanizer. He takes a break from his playboy lifestyle to attend his brother's wedding, where he becomes reacquainted with Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner), the only girl who ever captured his heart. After Connor delivers a drunken speech at the rehearsal dinner where he says that love isn't real, he's met in the bathroom by the ghost of his uncle Wayne (Michael Dogulas), a Hefner-esque horndog who taught Connor everything he knows about picking up chicks. Uncle Wayne informs Connor that, over the course of the evening, he'll be visited by three ghosts who will lead him through his romantic past, present, and future. Will Connor learn to get over himself and love the right woman, or will he remain an emotional Scrooge? \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 40 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c547d3111be684a12713397eea5533670518fadd","amp;dn":"Ghosts+of+Girlfriends+Past%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c547d3111be684a12713397eea5533670518fadd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,71,211,17,27,230,132,161,39,19,57,126,234,85,51,103,5,24,250,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
