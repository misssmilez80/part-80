Jerry Lee Lewis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ It'll Be Me.\n\n&quot;75 Pumping Piano Greats&quot; is packed with Pounding Piano Rock 'n' Rollers, Rhythm &amp; Blues shakers and lots more besides... 75 vintage rockin' tracks in a wide range of styles, all featuring great poundin' pumpin' piano.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis changed Rock &amp; Roll. Hitherto, R&amp;R records had been predominantly either sax or guitar dominated, piano having largely been relegated to a supporting role, as part of the rhythm section. Even Little RichardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strident piano was usually buried under layers of riffing saxes. But after Jerry Lee, things were noticeably different - and on the back of his success, a whole lot of piano-pounders were to enjoy a new, reinvigorated lease of life.\n\nOf course, Boogie-Woogie went right back to the birth of recorded sound, a staple element of Blues repertoire, aptly demonstrated herein by Pete Johnson, Camille Howard, Little Willie Littlefield, Amos Milburn and Cecil Gant, whilst Merrill E.Moore, Chuck Miller, Moon Mullican and Freddie Slack present equally-powerful white, Countrified interpretations. Jerry Lee, of course, brought Boogie-Woogie to Rock &amp; Roll, but guys like Owen Bradley, Roy Hall, Floyd Cramer - and particularly, Chuck BerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collaborator, Johnnie Johnson - sure knew how to lay down a rockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ solo or two, as they so readily demonstrate. Fats DominoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy-rollinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, New Orleans style adapted readily to R&amp;R, whereas his near-neighbour Professor Longhair trod a somewhat funkier path, sticking closer to R&amp;B - as did guys like Champion Jack Dupree, Huey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PianoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Smith, Ike Turner, Rosco Gordon and Lloyd Glenn. Ray CharlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ music crossed so many genres he was virtually impossible to categorise, as was, perhaps to a lesser extent, Piano Red.\n\nAll these and more are featured on this unique 3-CD set, which presents 75 wild, piano-propelled slices of RockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Roll, R&amp;B, Boogie-Woogie, Blues, Country and raw Hillbilly music. Featuring more than thirty different piano-pumpers, the pace never lets up and all musical boxes are well and truly ticked.
