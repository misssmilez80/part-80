This section has information that is vital to successfully running Batman: Arkham Asylum on your system.\n\n\n1.1\tDirectX\n\nThis game is optimised for Microsoft's DirectX 9.0c.  In order for you to play the game, you must have DirectX 9.0c compliant drivers for your video card and sound card.  Please note that although DirectX 9.0c is installed with the game, your video and sound card drivers will not be upgraded to DirectX 9.0c drivers.\n\nYou will need to obtain the latest DirectX 9.0c drivers from the manufacturer or PC supplier. These drivers cannot be supplied by Eidos.\n\n\n1.2\tMemory and Performance\n\nWhile the game will run fine in 1GB of RAM (2GB on Windows Vista), your playing experience will be smoother if you have more memory.\n\nRegardless of how much memory you have, you can maximize your available memory and increase the overall performance of the game engine by doing the following:\n\nq\tClosing any open windows\nq\tShutting down all other programs (including those that run in the menu-bar)\nq\tDefragmenting your hard drive\nq\tShutting down the Windows Sidebar (Windows Vista)\n\nEidos recommends that you have no other programs running at all while playing Batman: Arkham Asylum. Other programs, including system utilities and screen savers can cause system degradation when playing games and may conflict with the game for system resources, potentially resulting in instability and crashes.\n\n\n1.3 \tKnown Issues\n\nq\tEnsure you are running latest drivers from nVidia and ATI/AMD. There are several known issues with earlier versions of their drivers that affect the performance and stability of Batman: Arkham Asylum.\nq\tIf you experience any issues in game this could be linked to your sound card, Microsoft XP users should try to fix the problem by reducing the hardware acceleration option within the DXDIAG tool ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ To Run DXDIAG see the `Technical support section` below, once loaded select the SOUND tab and move the slider option (Hardware Sound Acceleration) to the left. Please note, this option is only available to Microsoft XP users.\nq\tATI Radeon X1000 series cards - (Radeon X1300, Radeon X1650, Radeon X1950 GT, etc.). Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â \nThese graphics cards may experience motion blur issues when ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDetective ModeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is activated in game. Batman (TM) may appear blurry and have several outlines. This issue can be resolved by turning off the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMotion BlurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ option in the launcher / settings.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â \nq\tA small number of users may experience a crash on start-up when attempting to initialise the .NET framework for the Launcher application. The Launcher application is required to customise your settings and has to run before the game can be played. Please read the instructions to work around this issue in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSupportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ folder on your Batman: Arkham Asylum DVD.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Technical Issues\n\n2.1\tInstallation &amp; Set-up\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nThe minimum system requirements are as follows:\n\nOPERATING SYSTEM:\nMicrosoft Windows XP or Vista\nCPU:\nIntel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3500+\nRAM:\n1GB for Windows XP\n2GB for Windows Vista\nGRAPHICS:\nnVidia 6600 or ATI 1300\nSOUND:\nMicrosoft Windows XP/Vista compatible sound card (100% DirectX 9.0c -compatible)\nDVD-ROM:\nQuad-speed (4x) DVD-ROM drive\nHARD DRIVE:\n9GB free disk space\nINPUT DEVICES:\n100% Windows XP/Vista compatible mouse and keyboard\n\nThe recommended system requirements are as follows:\n\nOPERATING SYSTEM:\nMicrosoft Windows XP or Vista\nCPU:\nCore 2 Duo E6600 (2.4Ghz) or AthlonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â 64 X2 4600+ \nRAM:\n2GB for Windows XP\n3GB for Windows Vista\nGRAPHICS:\nnVidia 9800GTX or ATI 3870\nSOUND:\nMicrosoft Windows XP/Vista compatible sound card (100% DirectX 9.0c -compatible)\nDVD-ROM:\nQuad-speed (4x) DVD-ROM drive\nHARD DRIVE:\n9GB free disk space\nINPUT DEVICES:\n100% Windows XP/Vista compatible mouse and keyboard / Xbox 360 Controller for Windows\n\n\nPreparing Your Hard Drive\n\nTo ensure that your installation is trouble free, you should check to see that your hard drive and file system are both tuned for optimum performance. Windows comes with a utility programs that will help optimise your hard drive performance. \n\nYou can optimise your hard drive's performance by running a program called Disk Defragmenter. You can run Disk Defragmenter by clicking on the Start button from the Windows desktop, followed by Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, and finally Disk Defragmenter.\n\n\n2.2\tDVD-ROM Problems\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum requires at least a Quad-Speed DVD-ROM drive with 32/64-bit Windows drivers.\n\nI receive a &quot;xxxxxx.xxx not found&quot; error message when installing or running Batman: Arkham Asylum.\n\nThis error message is usually the result of your computer using MS-DOS (16 bit) drivers instead of Windows (32/64 bit) drivers for your DVD-ROM drive. You can easily check to see if this is causing problems by opening the Control Panel (either click on the My Computer icon or click on the Start button followed by Settings, then Control Panel). \n\nIn the Control Panel window, double-click on the System icon then click on the Performance tab. You should now see a summary of the performance status of your computer. One of the lines should say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFile System: 32/64-bitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the last line should say &quot;Your system is configured for optimal performance.&quot; If you see a message saying &quot;Drive X is using MS-DOS compatibility mode,&quot; then you will need to contact your system vendor to obtain and install 32/64-bit drivers for your DVD-ROM drive.\n\n\n2.3\tCrashes and Lock-Ups\n\nWhen I start Batman: Arkham Asylum my mouse cursor disappears and my computer locks-up.\n\nChances are your installed audio card drivers are not compatible with DirectX. The only solution is to get a DirectX 9.0c -compatible driver from your audio card manufacturer.\n\n\nWhen I start Batman: Arkham Asylum I receive the following error message:\n\n&quot;The application ShippingPC-BmGame.exe referenced memory at address xxxx:xxxx that can't be read from.&quot;\n\nIt's likely that your installed video card drivers are not compatible with DirectX 9.0c. The only solution is to get a DirectX 9.0c -compatible driver from your video card manufacturer.\n\n\nThe Installer keeps stopping when a certain percentage is complete.\n\nThere a few likely causes:\n\nq\tYou may have run out of free space on your hard drive. Please remove unwanted programs to free up additional space for the game, and then reinstall Batman: Arkham Asylum\nq\tThere may be dirt or fingerprints on the DVD-ROM disc itself. Examine the bottom of the disc; if you see any fingerprints or dirt, carefully clean the disc using a clean, soft, lint-free cloth by wiping from the centre of the disc (near the hole) towards the outer edge in a straight line.\n\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is crashing to the desktop with no error messages.\n\nThis problem can be caused by several different things. Here's a list of the most common culprits associated with these crashes:\n\nq\tMake sure the DVD-ROM is clean (check for both scratches and smudges on the reading surface of the DVD).\n\nq\tMake sure the game has been installed properly. \n\nq\tMake sure DirectX 9.0c has been installed properly. \n\nq\tMake sure you have the latest drivers for your video card and that they are DirectX 9.0c -compatible. \n\nq\tMake sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card and that they are DirectX 9.0c -compatible. \n\nq\tMake sure Virtual Memory is enabled on your system. \n\nq\tRun Disk Defragmenter. \n\nq\tTry exiting the game, rebooting your machine, and re-entering the game.\n\n\nNote: \tIf your system crashes to the desktop while playing Batman: Arkham Asylum you should probably reboot your computer before starting a new play session.  Otherwise, DirectX may be in a locked state, and the game will be unable to use your sound or video hardware.\n\n\n2.4\tFirewall and Required Ports\n\nWhen you Install Batman: Arkham Asylum the installation process will automatically add the game to the list of exceptions for Windows Firewall. This is required to allow the user full access to Games For Windows - LIVE.\nThe following ports are required to be opened to use Games For Windows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ LIVE.\n\n    * TCP port 80 (Internet)\n    * TCP port 443 (Sign In)\n    * TCP port 3074 (Content Download)\n\nTo get the most up to date list of ports required for Games for Windows - LIVE go to\n\n\n2.5\tTechnical Support\n\nIf you need further technical assistance after reading the Readme file please do not hesitate to contact us using any of the methods listed below.\n\nWhen contacting us, please be sure to provide us with as much information as possible.
