The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n\nTracklist\nA1 \t\tCranky Spanky \t4:45 \t\nA2 \t\tStella By Starlight \t8:50 \t\nA3 \t\tMy Heart Stood Still \t5:33 \t\nB1 \t\tLittle Melonae \t8:20 \t\nB2 \t\tStanley\\'s Stiff Chickens \t9:25 \t\n\n\n\n    * Bass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Spanky de Brest*\n    * Drums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Art Blakey\n    * Piano ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sam Dockery\n    * Saxophone [Alto] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jackie McLean\n    * Trumpet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bill Hardman\n\nNotes\n\nRecorded 1957 on Columbia CL 1040\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ec2bf2a219fb6a7d71076b775a6c0450ebcba0a","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+The+Jazz+Messengers+-+Hard+Bop+-+%5BFLAC%5D+-+320+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ec2bf2a219fb6a7d71076b775a6c0450ebcba0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,194,191,42,33,159,182,167,215,16,118,183,117,166,192,69,14,188,186,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
