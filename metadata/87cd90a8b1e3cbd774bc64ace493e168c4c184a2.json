Lee Ermey\n\nEpisode Name: MG2 (Machine Guns 2)\n\nEpisode Synopsis: \n\nWhen today's warriors go toe-to-toe in combat the weapon they rely on is the machine gun. From the crude machines of the 19th century to the slick weapons of today, Gunny takes us on a journey that looks at the engineering development of this rapid-fire battle winner. Learn how the &quot;potato digger&quot; machine gun got it's name, and why a hand held gun developed in 1965 is still the weapon of choice for the toughest warriors on the planet. Ermey compares the machine guns that stormed the beaches of D-Day--the Bren gun and the B.A.R.--with a classic shooting match. Then, Gunny cuts loose with the Special Forces wonder weapon, the MP-5, as used by the British SAS and American Navy Seals. Not only will you see these weapons in action, but with cutting-edge 3D GFX you will go inside the weapons--to see close up and personal the mechanism, operation and evolution of the machine gun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87cd90a8b1e3cbd774bc64ace493e168c4c184a2","amp;dn":"Lock.N.Load.With.R.Lee.Ermey.S01E12.MG2_HDTV.xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87cd90a8b1e3cbd774bc64ace493e168c4c184a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,205,144,168,177,227,203,215,116,188,100,172,228,147,225,104,196,193,132,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
