From wildly imaginative kung fu showdowns to dance sequences featuring tuxedoed mobsters, you've never seen action this outrageous and characters this zany! With jaw-dropping fight sequences by Yuen Wo Ping (famed action choreographer of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix), Kung Fu Hustle will blow you away! In a town ruled by the Axe Gang, Sing (Stephen Chow) desperately wants to become a member. He stumbles into a slum ruled by eccentric landlords who turn out to be kung fu masters in disguise. Sing's actions eventually cause the Axe Gang and the slumlords to engage in an explosive kung fu battle. Only one side will win and only one hero will emerge as the greatest kung fu master of all.\n\nGenre:Action | Comedy | Crime | Fantasy\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease HELP SEED so others can also enjoy the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f03cc011aac41a335b24b36c7e7421547f6715c","amp;dn":"Kung+Fu+Hustle.1080p.AC3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f03cc011aac41a335b24b36c7e7421547f6715c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,3,204,1,26,172,65,163,53,178,75,54,199,231,66,21,71,246,113,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
