She writes her own songs and plays the guitar, piano and more. I love her voice. She reminds me of Ingrid Michaelson in style. I have permission from the artist to try to spread her music like wildfire by all means. Expect a bonux album with extra songs soon! Enjoy!\n\nUploaded by\n--CTDragon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1e035af8e019efed4db0cca15ecd98d9822301","amp;dn":"Molly%5C%27s+Untitled+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1e035af8e019efed4db0cca15ecd98d9822301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,30,3,90,248,224,25,239,237,77,176,204,161,94,205,152,217,130,35,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
