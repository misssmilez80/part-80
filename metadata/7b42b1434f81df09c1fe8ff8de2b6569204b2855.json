And lest I forget, we have the added bonus of Dexter Gordon joining in for some serious chops exchange on the aptly named blues Dexter's Deck.\n\nPersonnel:\nHampton Hawes: piano\nHenry Franklin: bass\nMichael Carvin: drums\nDexter Gordon: tenor sax on DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Deck\n\nHampton Hawes - Live at the Montmartre Tracks:\n01  The Camel\n02  Little Miss Laurie\n03  Broad Blue Acres\n04  This GuyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s In Love With You\n05  Footprints\n06  Spanish Way\n07  DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Deck \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b42b1434f81df09c1fe8ff8de2b6569204b2855","amp;dn":"Hampton+Hawes+-+Live+at+the+Montmartre+%281971%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b42b1434f81df09c1fe8ff8de2b6569204b2855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,66,177,67,79,129,223,9,193,254,143,248,222,43,101,105,32,75,40,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
