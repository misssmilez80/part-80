Charlies began suffering from internal difficulties in 1971, the band split, reformed with a different lineup, and started playing very varying styles of material. Three tracks for a proposed single were recorded in 1973, but two of them were released on a compilation only, and the third one was dug up from the vaults and released on a compilation CD in 1998. After more lineup changes Charlies split in 1975. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Taiteen KritiikistÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ 3:30\n02. Rautavaimo 6:51\n03. Don\\'t Go Out 2:25\n04. There\\'s Nothing Trough... 1:56\n05.
