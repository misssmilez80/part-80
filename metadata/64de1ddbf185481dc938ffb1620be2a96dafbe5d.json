I don't really know what ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Gold Dust WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is about. I know there was cocaine there and that I fancied it gold dust, somehow. I'm going to have to go back to my journals and see if I can pull something out about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Gold Dust Woman.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Because I don't really know. It's weird that I'm not quite sure. It can't be all about cocaine. \n\n\nA cover version by Hole was released on the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels and was produced by former Cars leader Ric Ocasek.\n\n\n\nGreat clip and song\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64de1ddbf185481dc938ffb1620be2a96dafbe5d","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Gold+Dust+Woman.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64de1ddbf185481dc938ffb1620be2a96dafbe5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,222,29,219,241,133,72,29,201,56,255,177,98,11,226,169,109,175,190,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
