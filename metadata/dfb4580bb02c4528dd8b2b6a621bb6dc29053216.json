Still there is more at hand for the Rider and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound by a tangle of promises he may not be able to keep.\n\nFirst is EragonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s oath to his cousin Roran: to help rescue RoranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beloved, Katrina, from King GalbatorixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clutches. But Eragon owes his loyalty to others, too. The Varden are in desperate need of his talents and strengthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as are the elves and dwarves. When unrest claims the rebels and danger strikes from every corner, Eragon must make choicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ choices that take him across the Empire and beyond, choices that may lead to unimagined sacrifice.\n\nEragon is the greatest hope to rid the land of tyranny. Can this once-simple farm boy unite the rebel forces and defeat the king?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfb4580bb02c4528dd8b2b6a621bb6dc29053216","amp;dn":"Brisingr+-+Christopher+Paolini-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfb4580bb02c4528dd8b2b6a621bb6dc29053216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,180,88,11,176,44,69,40,221,139,43,106,98,27,182,220,41,5,50,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
