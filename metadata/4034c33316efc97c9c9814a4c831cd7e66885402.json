We quickly struck up a friendship, found out we lived practically down the street from each other and have become inseparable confidantes. Skolnik, who, to this day, refuses to tell me his last name, wanted to use his new computer to mess around with music for those nerdy types who enjoy listening to sound manipulations that have applied out-of-phasing techniques. Although he SWEARS it's a difficult and demaning process, I beg to differ with the good doctor. In the end, he does make some weird and interesting sounds with his software that he claims to have developed. I know better...Bottom line is, the sound is good, better than most OOP projects, and demands the listener pay attention or he will be lost in the shuffle. Skolnik likes to think of himself as a professor type even though I think he's just a kook most of the time. To be perfectly frank, I'm even sure if Skolnik is his real name either. I think he's just a big &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; fan. One day I swear I'll find out!\n\n\nSo why do this you might ask? Well, we're music geeks, pure and simple. Skolnik rarely ventures outside, let alone from his PC, for the sun hurts his eyes. He tells me he's not particularly fond of conversing with other human beings. I guess I'm one of his few &quot;social outlets&quot;. We're just two enthusiastic young men who enjoy listening to music from a different perspective. And OOPing does just that. You never know what you're going to end up with when applying the type of processing we employ...well, Skolnik employs. By the way, NONE of these recordings are left or right channel isolations as they are a real CHEAP way to pass off OOP tracks. Skolnik gets real pissed with &quot;outfakes&quot; that claim to be OOP when, in fact, they are just isolated stereo tracks. Any schlub can do that!\nHaving said all that, we started Two Boys Limited Labs. It's not the most inventive name, but that's not what we do so we're not too terribly concerned. It's a name...big deal.\nNow a little about our releases...We have handpicked the artists and songs here based solely on our likings. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I do the art, Skolnik does the music. It just works best that wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nWE DO NOT SELL THESE DISCS!! PERIOD!! Copyrights are owned by the copyright owners, period. We simply take commercial releases and make them sound different, that's allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nENJOY!!\n\n~ The Guy who wrote this...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Handle With Care (3:16)\n02.
