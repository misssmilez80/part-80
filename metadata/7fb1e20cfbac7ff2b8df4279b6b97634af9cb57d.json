The\nSan Francisco-based quintet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ co-founded by Billy Rowe, onetime guitarist for Jetboy\n(a band All Music Guide calls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the best-kept secrets of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“80s glam metalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nblend a punk-influenced pop-metal aesthetic with the melodic allure and accessible\nhooks of classic pop radio. If the New Wave Of Classic Rock is in session, American\nHeartbreak is at the head of the class.\n\nAlong with vocalist Lance Boone and former Exodus bassist Michael Butler (currently\nthe host of the highly successful weekly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock and Roll Geek ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Podcast), Rowe\nfirst introduced American Heartbreak to rock fans via the 1997 EP What You Deserve,\ninitially released on Perris Records. After several tribute album contributions and\nlineup changes, their first full-length, Postcards From Hell, surfaced three years\nlater on hometown indie Coldfront Records. The album recalled the unpretentious fun\nof supercharged Sunset Strip rock while reinterpreting the buzz-saw melodies of\narena rock legends such as Kiss and Cheap Trick for a post-alternative rock age.\n\nFollowing a 2001 split-CD with The Libertines, the group added rhythm guitarist\nCasey Crenshaw prior to a European tour, during which they recorded a live set that\nbecame the foundation of their next release. 2003ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s You Will Not Be Getting Paid\n(Perris Records) featured five live songs, five acoustic tracks (including Starz\nand Cheap Trick covers) and six remixed songs from the What You Deserve EP.\n\nAfter the European releases of You Will Not Be Getting Paid and Postcards From Hell\nin 2004 (People Like You Records), the group returned to the continent for another\ntour in early 2005. Back on the home front, they toured the West Coast with\nBackyard Babies, The Chelsea Smiles and Crash Kelly that summer. (The group has\nalso toured and/or gigged with The New York Dolls, The Donnas, Queens of the Stone\nAge, Buckcherry, Warrant, Cinderella, The Scorpions, Dio, Sebastian Bach, L.A.\nGuns, Starz and Tsar, among others.)\n\nBy yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end, the band completed its second full-length with co-producer Rick\nParker (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Space Twins [Weezer guitarist Brian BellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nside project], Tyler Hilton). The result: 13 tracks of timeless rock nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll. It\nproves that while trend-seekers may be fawning over the latest batch of rock\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsaviorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as if the genre was invented only yesterday, American Heartbreak is the\nreal deal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a band impervious to fads and driven purely by the desire to play\nloud, catchy rock.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb1e20cfbac7ff2b8df4279b6b97634af9cb57d","amp;dn":"American_Heartbreak-American_Heartbreak-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb1e20cfbac7ff2b8df4279b6b97634af9cb57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,177,226,12,251,172,127,242,184,223,66,121,182,185,118,52,175,156,181,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
