This Contemporary set (reissued on CD in the OJC series) was McGhee's finest recording of the period, a quartet outing with brilliant pianist Phineas Newborn, bassist Leroy Vinnegar, and drummer Shelly Manne. Although tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards is not on the date, two of his compositions (his famous &quot;Sunset Eyes&quot; and a tribute to the trumpeter, &quot;Maggie's Back in Town&quot;) are fully explored by the quartet. Other titles include three standards plus McGhee's original blues &quot;Demon Chase.&quot; This CD is a perfect starting point for listeners not familiar with the underrated (and often overlooked) Howard McGhee. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist\n1.
