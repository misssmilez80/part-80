It contains all the applications you need: a web browser, office suite, media apps, instant messaging and much more.\n\nUbuntu is an open-source alternative to Windows and Office.\n\n\nThe Ubuntu promise\n\nUbuntu will always be free of charge, along with its regular enterprise releases and security updates\nUbuntu comes with full commercial support from Canonical and hundreds of companies from across the world\nUbuntu provides the best translations and accessibility features that the free software community has to offer\nUbuntu core applications are all free and open source. We want you to use free and open source software, improve it and pass it on.\n\nOur Philosophy\n\nOur work is driven by a philosophy on software freedom that aims to spread and bring the benefits of software to all parts of the world. At the core of the Ubuntu Philosophy are these core philosophical ideals:\nEvery computer user should have the freedom to download, run, copy, distribute, study, share, change and improve their software for any purpose, without paying licensing fees.\nEvery computer user should be able to use their software in the language of their choice.\nEvery computer user should be given every opportunity to use software, even if they work under a disability.\nOur philosophy is reflected in the software we produce and included in our distribution. As a result, the licensing terms of the software we distribute are measured against our philosophy, using the Ubuntu License Policy.\n\nWhen you install Ubuntu almost all of the software installed already meets these ideals, and we are working to ensure that every single piece of software you need is available under a license that gives you those freedoms.\n\nCurrently, we make a specific exception for some &quot;drivers&quot; which are only available in binary form, without which many computers will not complete the Ubuntu installation. We place these in a restricted section of your system which makes them easy to remove if you do not need them.\n\n\nFree software\n\nFor Ubuntu, the 'free' in 'free software' is used primarily in reference to freedom, and not to price - although we are committed to not charging for Ubuntu. The most important thing about Ubuntu is that it confers rights of software freedom on the people who install and use it. It is these freedoms that enable the Ubuntu community to grow, continue to share its collective experience and expertise to improve Ubuntu and make it suitable for use in new countries and new industries.\n\nQuoting the Free Software Foundation's 'What is Free Software', the freedoms at the core of free software are defined as:\n\nThe freedom to run the programme, for any purpose.\nThe freedom to study how the programme works and adapt it to your needs.\nThe freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.\nThe freedom to improve the programme and release your improvements to the public, so that everyone benefits.\nOpen source\nOpen source is a term coined in 1998 to remove the ambiguity in the English word 'free'. The Open Source Initiative described open source software in the Open Source Definition. Open source continues to enjoy growing success and wide recognition.\n\nUbuntu is happy to call itself open source. While some refer to free and open source as competing movements with different ends, we do not see free and open source software as either distinct or incompatible. Ubuntu proudly includes members who identify with both movements.ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456f6c596a1caf3b740eb5958289625b4a520429","amp;dn":"%5BISO%5D+Ubuntu+Desktop+9.10+%28Karmic+Koala%29+DVD+amd64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456f6c596a1caf3b740eb5958289625b4a520429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,111,108,89,106,28,175,59,116,14,181,149,130,137,98,91,74,82,4,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
