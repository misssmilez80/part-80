As players barnstorm across six massive, free-roaming play fields in search of clues for the location of the Red BaronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secret hideout, players can upgrade their aircraft with a collection of 25 unique, comical weapons and other unlockable gadgets, including the player-guided Woodstock missile. Classic Peanuts characters including Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, Marcie and Sally will aid Snoopy on his mission, providing him with hints and tips to track down the despicable Red Baron.\n\nA nap atop his doghouse transports Snoopy to his fanciful dreams of the French countryside, where he once again imagines himself as the virtuoso flying ace on a gallant quest to defend the skies from the evil Red Baron. Soaring through the clouds in SnoopyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s famous Sopwith Camel bi-plane, players find themselves engaged in sky-high dogfights, exhilarating air races and daring missions behind enemy lines. Battle the BaronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minions across SnoopyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s imagined WWI France in an engrossing single-player adventure, then engage your friends in multiplayer dogfighting and minigames!\n\n\nPlayers control Snoopy as he flies an assortment of missions in his trusty Sopwith Camel. Missions occur in numerous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtheatersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that are slowly unlocked as you progress through the game. In addition to mission objectives, each ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a number bonus goals that you can choose to accomplish at your leisure. These generally involve shooting down colored balloons and locating hidden letters. \n\nParticipating in combat and completing bonus goals allows you to purchase upgrades for your plane. You can acquire Woodstock-guided missiles, water balloons, a potato shotgun, and more. While the challenge level isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly high, there are lots of missions and as the difficulty ramps up, you certainly wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to sleepwalk through them. The difficulty level and forgiving controls appears to be well suited for less experienced players. The developers took a bunch of good ideas from other titles and assembled a rock solid action game for the younger set.\n\n\n\n Install Notes\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n 1. Burn or Mount the image\n 2.
