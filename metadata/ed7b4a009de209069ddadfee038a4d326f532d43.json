Ward or Loren MazzaCane Connors. With the exception of the epic 20-minute bliss-out &quot;Ocean M31,&quot; the 15 songs on their second album are brief explorations of specific sounds and moods, rarely merely pretty but keeping away from full-on atonal noise. At album's end, the transcendently lovely &quot;Balfour Hollis&quot; serves as a brief, melodic release to an album that expertly maintains a subtle but effective tension throughout.\n(Review from allmusic.com)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed7b4a009de209069ddadfee038a4d326f532d43","amp;dn":"Fires+Were+Shot+-+Solace+%28lossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed7b4a009de209069ddadfee038a4d326f532d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,123,74,0,157,226,9,6,157,218,223,238,3,138,77,50,111,83,45,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
