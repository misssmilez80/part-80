Designed as a vehicle for Our Gang's Jackie Cooper -- then all of \n\nnine years old -- Skippy jettisons most of the trenchant cynicism of Crosby's creation (the strip was something of a 1930s Calvin and Hobbes) in favor of \n\nsentiment. Skippy, the son of the local health inspector (Willard Robertson) conspires with his best friend, Sooky (Robert Coogan), a poor kid, to raise \n\nenough money for a dog license. The mutt in question is eventually shot by the mean dogcatcher, and the effect on Skippy and Sooky (not to mention the \n\naudience) is devastating. The tragedy leads Skippy's dad to soften his disciplinarian stance and to draw closer to his son. Skippy was followed by an \n\neven more lachrymose sequel, Sooky, also released in 1931. Twenty-five years later, Jackie Cooper, by that time a prominent TV producer/director, tried \n\nto revive Skippy as a weekly series, with future My Three Sons co-star Stanley Livingston in the lead. \n\n\n\n\nAwards:Won Oscar.
