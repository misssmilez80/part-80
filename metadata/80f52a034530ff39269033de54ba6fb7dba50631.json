Plasma loops cover a wide range of sizes and range in temperature from tens of thousands to millions of degrees. They not only define the structure of individual active regions but connect different active regions--even across the solar equator. Loops also play an integral and decisive role in the enormous solar explosions called flares. Over recent years a wealth of space and ground-based observations of loops has been obtained in various widely-spaced regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this book the authors have selected the best observational material from the literature on which to base a detailed account of the properties of flare and non-flare loops. The book also explores the larger implications of the loop structures for our understanding of solar and stellar coronae. The text is enhanced by a large number of illustrations and unique and beautiful photographs obtained from the ground and from space.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f52a034530ff39269033de54ba6fb7dba50631","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B1991%5D+Plasma+Loops+in+the+Solar+Corona+%28Cambridge+Astrop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f52a034530ff39269033de54ba6fb7dba50631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,245,42,3,69,48,255,57,38,144,51,222,84,186,111,183,219,165,6,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
