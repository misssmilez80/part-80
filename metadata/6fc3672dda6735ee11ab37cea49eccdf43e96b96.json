More importantly, it has all of the songs, from Enigma (&quot;Return to Innocence,&quot; &quot;Sadeness Part I&quot;), Deep Forest (&quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot;) and Enya (&quot;Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)&quot;) to Jean Michel Jarre (&quot;Oxygene Part IV&quot;), Angelo Badalamenti (&quot;Theme from Twin Peaks&quot;), Mark Isham (&quot;My Wife with Champagne Shoulders&quot;), DJ Dado (&quot;X-Files Theme&quot;) and Mike Oldfield (&quot;Tubular Bells, Pt. 1&quot;). In short, it's new age music for the pop music fan or the baby boomer, and it's hard to imagine that another compilation could cover the same ground quite as well.\n\n\nThis is the CD frequently advertised on TV around the mid 90's in North America:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc3672dda6735ee11ab37cea49eccdf43e96b96","amp;dn":"VA+-+Pure+Moods+%281997%29+%5Bas+seen+on+TV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc3672dda6735ee11ab37cea49eccdf43e96b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,195,103,45,218,103,53,238,17,171,55,206,164,158,204,223,67,233,107,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
