(1970) \n\nFor some reason the title appears as &quot;Which the Front?(1970)&quot; if I use space between words. \n\nIt's a VHS-rip and the only English speaking copy on ze interwebz. No doubt one of the most obscure cult classics ever uploaded on torrents.\n\nJerry Lewis directs and stars in this VERY silly WW2 comedy, and even though you'll probably hate it, it's worth checking out because of it's rarity. There are plenty of unfunny scenes but some of them are fucking awesome. I always loved this movie like the retarded brother I never had.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f0ceba6cbb6a7da0205b43b292cce800eb914ef","amp;dn":"WhichWaytotheFront%3F+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f0ceba6cbb6a7da0205b43b292cce800eb914ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,12,235,166,203,182,167,218,2,5,180,59,41,44,206,128,14,185,20,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
