Slowly ostracized at home and\n work, they learn the value of self and solidarity as they struggle to\n maintain dignity and find happiness. Focus marks the directorial debut of\n award-winning photographer Neal Slavin, and is adapted by Kendrew Lascelles\n from the Arthur Miller novel of the same name. The film stars William H.\n Macy, Laura Dern, David Paymer and Meat Loaf Aday.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246628/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246628/&lt;/a&gt; &gt;&gt; 6.8/10 (2101 votes)\n\nSweDream.net Ny Tacker ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œppen Regg\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f10ca80455d27e73428c23fe52939f6f1874d72","amp;dn":"Focus.2001.NORDiC.PAL.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f10ca80455d27e73428c23fe52939f6f1874d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,16,202,128,69,93,39,231,52,40,194,63,229,41,57,246,241,135,77,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
