Thunderkings and Predators. Do you know your fireworks? Just in time for July 4 comes Boomtown, a lively visit to the Suquamish Nation near Seattle, where selling fireworks has become a tradition for some Suquamish tribal members. For 30 years, this part of Indian country has sold fireworks that are officially banned off the reservation, attracting non-Indian buyers from near and far. And then on July 4th, the Suquamish tribe plays host to one of the most enjoyable and unpredictable fireworks shows around. In a place where federal, state and local policies routinely collide with Native sovereignty, Boomtown focuses on this animated enterprise, offering a special glimpse into contemporary Indian life, where Native tradition meets today's economic realities with uniquely successful results.\n\n\n\n\nSorry about the quality, it's an old VHS rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21bebaa4d1ff513850e9777290da52f65d5306a6","amp;dn":"PBS+POV+P.O.V.+Boomtown+2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21bebaa4d1ff513850e9777290da52f65d5306a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,190,186,164,209,255,81,56,80,233,119,114,144,218,82,246,93,83,6,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
