Jaew is confused that her grandmother would call her to come for this reason, but Yai Jaem gives her an ultimatum that if Jaew dosnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t follow through then she may very well stress to death.\n\nJaew Jai Rai Gub Khun Chai TevadaJaew is forced to accept her grandmotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wishes when she knows that 20 years ago after her father and mother passed away.

She is confused and curious in his behaviour. She believed that he would be a young child, but it appears that he is a grown person that is of the same generation as she is. On top of that Chai verbally says things that directs towards Jaew even if she didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what was going on. Jaew argues back and causes Khun Nou Chai to be very upset and angry. He retaliates harshly and the two argue and battle it out verbally to where it becomes nearly as large as a war in the middle of the city to the pointg where Yai or Ekburud (Aou Panu Suwanoh) and Nong Lek or Naree (Bee Matika Ataragornsiripoh) the older brother and younger sister and children from Dood DaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (Poo Sara Ratroom Reuangwong), ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Step-mothers first marriage have to go and tell Chatwan (Chok Trin Saisotchok) his father so that he could come and stop the events that is occurring.\n\nJaew Jai Rai Gub Khun Chai TevadaChatawan seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the condition of the house that has came a mess from the argument between Chai and Jaew. Everyone is in peace and Dood Dao asks what had happened and the reasons for it and Chai then responds by telling her to stay out of his business. Chatwan has to stop and separate everyone and turns around to clear JaewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story first and then finds out that she is the grand daughter of Yai Jaem and she is there to take care of Khun Nou. JaewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s answer causes confusion among everyone especially Chai because that house only has one Khun Nou which is him causing Jaew to be shocked! On top of that the person she must take care of is someone with a bad temper and likes to talk down to people. They quickly go to ask Yai Jaem for the truth and she informÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s them that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true and Chai ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jaew are both upset and they are even more stressed when the doctor orders them to try not to stress out the patient; so the two are forced to join forces in this mission because they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to hurt Yai Jaem.\n\nThe position of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnannyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reflectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Jaew then starts up. Chai manifest all his might into annoying Jaew to the point where Jaew has to find many ways to handle his ways. Jaew must give in to him every time because he continously uses Nom Jaem as his source of power. Eventually Jaew is unable to tolerate it and quits. Chai is happy that he is able to get rid of Jaew from his life, but Yai Jaem pleads her to go back because Chai is about to be cheated out of his familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fortune by his step mother and Chert Sark (Ta Pataratnak Wilairot) the familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attorney. Jaew then soften up and agreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to go back to taking care of him with her own ways.\n\nBefore returning to finish her mission Jaew goes back to the resort to build up her strategy. She tells of her situation to Pa Pim and Loong Sing. They feel sorry for her and allows her to take a break from her original job. Only Seua (Sugat Bantawit Tragonpanit) Loon Sing and Pa PimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only child doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t agree because he is completely in love with PÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Jaew and he is afraid that Chai will cause her to be sensitive towards him to where Seua himself will be heart broken! Jaew lies to him and tells him that Chai is hideous in looks and personality and once he hears this he feels better and allows PÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Jaew to go. While at the resort Jaew comes up with many plans to handle Chai and finally succeeds.\nJaew Jai Rai Gub Khun Chai TevadaOn ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side he is still indulging in his victory over chasing Jaew away. He is careless about his conniving step mother and her son who have begun the plan for his father to hate him. They had suggested that Chatwan give an important position within the company to Chai to take care of. They also send Ying Nui (Game Boom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Piminipa Jidtatinrot) a royalty with only her name left who is dating Yai to be ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secretary. At first Chai refused and then he saw it as an oppurtunity to tumultuous at his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s company so he accepts. Ying Nui invites him out and drink to the point where he nearly misses an important meeting. Luckily Jaew returns and finds out the plan to get rid of Jaew from Nong Lek the daughter of Dood Dai who secretly likes Chai. Jaew finds Chai and once Chai seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s her his drunkness disappears. Jaew announces that she will no longer be sensitive and orders him to shower and get dressed and go to the meeting. He successfuly goes through the meeting in the midst of Dood Dao, Yai, and Chert SakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plan that had completely fell.\n\nJaew Jai Rai Gub Khun Chai TevadaAll the while Jaew is forcing Chai to sign a secret document in which he will accept, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ5 regulationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to have a better life than beforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which all include\n\n1. To be generous\n2. Not be self centered\n3. Be Afraid of Sins\n4. To be thankful for the things around you\n5. Open up your heart to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œloveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ others\n\nIf she is able to complete all 5 regulations then she will quit her position immediately, but if Chai is unable to do it then he will no longer have his freedom!\n\nChai is silent! With the new version of Jaew who is way more brutal than before. She is just as bad as he is he thinks about it and signs the contract with confidence that Jaew will be unable to change him. Jaew follows Chai everywhere, but he still acts out and continues to break the rules. Yai seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that Jaew doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like Jaew so he attempts to get close to her and pull her to his side, but Jaew knows of his plan so she tries to get far away from him. This causes Ying Nui to be very jealous and show often her jealousy towards Yai and Jaew. Yai tells her to hurry up and seduce Chai and make him fall in love with her. Ying Nui is frustrated so she takes her anger out on Nong Lek who doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know anything to the point where Jaew has to protect her often. This causes Nong Lek and Jaew to become even closer.\n\nNong Lek tells Chai good stories to Jaew and tells of Jaew cuteness to Chai also. This causes Chai to be curious as to how Jaew who is very brutal wins over Nong LekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart; Nong Lek who normally doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t associate with people. The curiousity of both Jaew and Chai towards one another slowly opens them up to each other without knowing. Seua seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that Jaew has been gone for a long time and runs away from Seua Pa Resort to go find Jaew in Krung Thep. Chai seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this and says that Jaew is Into younger boys and causes Seua to dislike Chai. Dood Dao starts to feel depressed because Jaew is able to change Chai and cause him to be more grown and mature. As time goes by Chatwan starts to feel better towards Chai. Suddenly Seua shows up and tries to convince Jaew to return and she must return as he asks, but she is unable to leave her job of taking care of Chai so she drugs him and takes him to Seua Pa Resort with her.\n\nJaew Jai Rai Gub Khun Chai TevadaAt the resort Jaew attempts to reform his behaviour by using him to work in so many ways, but regardless of what she does Chai refuses and continously attempts to run away. Many days pass by, Yai and Ying Nui finds that Chai came to stay with Jaew and follows. They then pretend to be guests who are really harsh and uses Chai to do many tasks as a servant. Jaew backs them up because she wants him to learn a lesson of how it feels when he uses other people; but on the opposite it causes him to become more irate. He then turns to Ying Nui as his help. Jaew then warns him that Ying Nui is attempting to harm him, but he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t listen to her and believes that she is there to mess up his life. Once Chai is able to adapt he finds way to bully Jaew, but she is able to retialiate everytime. Their closeness causes them to become closer without realizing it. While Chai is happy with being with Jaew, Yai Jaem gets better and follows them to the resort. Yai seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that Jaew and Chai are closer than just a person taking care of someone and feels uneasy about it so he talks to Yai Jaem and tells her to warn her grand daughter to not fall in love with someone with a higher status or her grand daughter will be hurt. Yai Jaem tells Jaew and Jaew gets sad and tries to break away from Chai. Chai is curious as to why and tries to make up with her forcing Yai Jaem to attempt to take him back to Krung Thep (Bangkok) without Jaew returning with them. Chai refuses and gives an ultimatum that Jaew must return to Tat Thep estate with him in order for him to return so Nom Jaem has no choice but to give in.\n\nJaew Jai Rai Gub Khun Chai TevadaAfter being home for awhile Chai then gets sick. Jaem takes him to the hospital and Chai meets with Pat (Nathalie Natinee Jianyanon) his friend that have been close since they were children. The two are really happy and jumps in to hug one another intimately. Jaew seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this and is sad opposite of Yai Jaem who knowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s of Chai and PatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s situation very well. She then prepares a plan to let the two fall in love. Chai and Pat seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s each other often and also know one another very well even Jaew has to fall to the side. In addition Chatwan is very ill and must rest at the hospital. Chai has to go work at the company in place of his father and let Jaew be his personal secretary in place of Ying Nui. Pat and Nom Jaem help each other take care of Chatwan the entire time. ChatwanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s illness causes him to be unable to speak and move. Dood Dao and Chert Sark then reveal their true colors. They begin the plan to get Chatwan to transfer all of his fortune to them. Dood Dao also reveals something that causes Chatwan to be even more sad. She tells him that she has been having an affair with Chert Sark for quite some time alreadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦causing Chatwan to get more ill even if Chatwan is unable to take this secret to tell anyone. Jaew coincidentally overhears Chert Sark planning with Dood Dao at the company. Other then the thieves are attemping to steal the Tat ThepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fortune they plan to kill Chatwan and Chai. Jaew tells this to Chai and he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe that Cherk Sark would plan with Dood Dao so Jaew takes this and tell Pat..\n\nThe next morning Jaew refuses to let Chai go to work, but he goes anyway, but luckily ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s car doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work and he rides his motorcycle to work with Jaew. Once Berm fix the car Yai drives Chai car to work. Chert Sark had sent someone to put a bomb in ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s car. While everyone is in a meeting Chert Sark still hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t came in. Suddenly there are cops who come to the meeting to arrest Dood Dao and Yai for fraud and attempted murder of Chatwan. Dood Dao quickly calls and warn Chert Sark. Yai is unable to accept and throws and fit and runs away. He quickly goes to ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s car and Dood Dao seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s her son about to board ChaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s car and tries to stop him, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to late because at that moment the car explodes into dust.
