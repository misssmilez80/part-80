It's the Battle of Thermopylae all\n  over again: one Russian fighter against 10 Afghanis!\n\n  9th Company recreates in detail the events that took place during the last\n  large-scale Soviet military operation. Few know the history: the 9th Company\n  of the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment came under heavy fire on Hill 3234 on\n  January 7th, 1988. They managed to stop several attacks by an estimated 400\n  Mujahideen and Pakistani mercenaries and held their position for two gory\n  days. The company lost 6 men, and the remaining 28 of the total 39 were\n  wounded. Two 9th Company soldiers were posthumously awarded the Golden Star\n  medal and the title of Soviet Hero.\n \n\n             \n   \n  1. Burn/Mount image\n  2. Install the game\n  3.
