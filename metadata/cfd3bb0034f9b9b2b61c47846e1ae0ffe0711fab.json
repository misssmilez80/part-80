I was managing my        |\n|  expectations when August Burns Red announced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConstellationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because I   |\n|  loved ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMessengersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if they could pull it off twice in a    |\n|  row. Well, call me Doubting Thomas, because they not only met my          |\n|  expectations they blew them out of the water. August Burns Red has        |\n|  progressed into one of the finest Metal bands today.                      |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Jake has a very similar guttural scream that he did on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMessengersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but  |\n|  with more range in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConstellationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. As you listen to this CD you will    |\n|  discover JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talent and range and how it fits perfectly in with the    |\n|  metal riffs, solos, heart-pounding drums, and ABRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature             |\n|  breakdowns. Speaking of the breakdowns, they are faster and more complex  |\n|  than any previous ABR projects. I found myself being captured by the      |\n|  breakdowns, they are catchy, groovy and just flat out epic. Through out   |\n|  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConstellationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ you will be surprised and excited by the diversity this  |\n|  band offers, especially in the building up of a song. And speaking of     |\n|  building up, that is one thing August Burns Red has perfected - the art   |\n|  of climax. They do this by creating a series of unexpected events - they  |\n|  will tone the tempo of a song down, throw in piano, bring out a guitar    |\n|  melting solo, and yes, they will even sing. That is why this is August    |\n|  Burns RedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most diverse and most promising album to date.                |\n|                                                                            |\n|  On the lyrical side of life, it seems as though ABR has brought it up a   |\n|  notch - each song is poetic and uses analogies and metaphors to describe  |\n|  an experience or a struggle we face daily. An example of this is from     |\n|  the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThirty and SevenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat will you become, what will become of   |\n|  you. Your mind is the mountain before you. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve reached the summit,     |\n|  now transcend the skies.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ From the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Escape ArtistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ there is a    |\n|  line Jake screams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour mouth is like a grenadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. These are just a        |\n|  couple of examples to wet your appetite.                                  |\n|                                                                            |\n|  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMetalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has been assaulted by a variety of variations over the year, but  |\n|  one thing ABR does that no other band has is keeping ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMetalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ original     |\n|  and not falling in with the fad that has seemed to take over the metal    |\n|  genre. Know this: August Burns Red has created an Epic piece of music     |\n|  that will take metal to a whole new level. You will not be disappointed.  |\n|                                                                            |\n|                                     |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd3bb0034f9b9b2b61c47846e1ae0ffe0711fab","amp;dn":"August_Burns_Red-Constellations-2009-pLAN9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd3bb0034f9b9b2b61c47846e1ae0ffe0711fab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,211,187,0,52,249,185,178,182,28,71,132,110,26,224,255,224,113,31,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
