These are collected from various sources around the internet - p2p and direct download - and I figured I'd upload them to make life easier for other fans of the show.\n\nFile size is large for a 20 minute episode, but I didn't encode them. They're TV rips, and decent enough quality. I considered including a sample, but tbh, these are the only known copies in English on the internet, so if you want the series, the quality will have to do. :)\n\nI'm in Europe, so bear in mind my PC waon't be on some night between 11pm and 8 am GMT. If there's no seeds, just comment here and I'll seed again.\n\nAnd help seed, ne? :)\n\nOh. And they're known to work on the PS3, through the PS3 Media Server application. :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4680a420af5b1ab66bf759023be6cf70a45c8747","amp;dn":"Snobs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4680a420af5b1ab66bf759023be6cf70a45c8747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,128,164,32,175,91,26,182,107,247,89,2,59,230,207,112,164,92,135,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
