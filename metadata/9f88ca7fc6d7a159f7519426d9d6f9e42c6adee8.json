Guests include Rich Vos on the \nphone, Heather Height from Hate Speech Radio and others.\n\nPosted by request. I haven't been upping any SNV as of late and many \ncan be downloaded easily from websites anyway. \n\n\n\n-start of rant-\n\nDisclaimer: Mothergoose56 doesn't condone any socialist propaganda \ncontained in this broadcast and neither should you. We have the \nConstitution for a reason. Politicians swear to uphold it: It \nstates that re-distribution of wealth is wrong - it does not coincide \nwith the stated goals of our Republic. &quot;Life, Liberty and the Pursuit \nof Happiness&quot; are the rights guaranteed to citizens. Health care is a \nSERVICE. Next we'll be forced to subsidize food for everyone because \n&quot;the children are starving! OMFG!!!&quot; \n\nThe US is in debt 10+ Trillion plus the over 50 Trillion in debt\nwe've mortgaged on the backs of our childrens children. Why don't\nwe think about those children before we spend more money we don't\nhave on un-Constitional bills. YES - the system has massive \nproblems. More government is not the answer - and the only way to\nwe'll begin to pay for it will be tax rates in excess of 50% of your\nincome. Plans such as the one at http://operationhealthfreedom.com \nare a step in the right direction.\n\n...Anthony must love XM202 being used to spread the &quot;Obamacare&quot; that\nhe angrily rails against. \n\n- end of rant --\n\n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month!\nGet your O&amp;A here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f88ca7fc6d7a159f7519426d9d6f9e42c6adee8","amp;dn":"Weird+Medicine+w%2F+Dr.+Steve+2009-11-07+CF128k+VBR+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f88ca7fc6d7a159f7519426d9d6f9e42c6adee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,136,202,127,198,215,161,89,247,81,148,38,217,214,249,228,44,106,222,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
