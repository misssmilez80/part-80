The story gets under way \n\nas the boy who will become Wolverine makes a shocking discovery about his family \n\nbloodline, and gains a brother in the process. Flash forward to find the mutant \n\nsiblings battling side by side through two world wars and Vietnam -- where they \n\nare sentenced to death for killing a commanding officer -- and Logan (Hugh \n\nJackman) and his brother, Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth, played by Liev Schreiber), \n\nhave joined a top-secret government task force. When their targets begin to \n\ninclude innocent civilians, conscientious Logan escapes to the Canadian Rockies, \n\nwhere he builds a home with pretty schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). \n\nInformed by his old commanding officer William Stryker (Danny Huston) that the \n\nmembers of his old team are being targeted for death, Logan is heartbroken when \n\nVictor finds and kills Kayla. Vowing revenge, Logan agrees to take part in a \n\ndangerous experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called \n\nadamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength \n\nneeded to defeat his powerful brother. Subsequently betrayed by Stryker, Logan \n\n(now Wolverine) sets out to find his blood-lusting brother and stop the cycle of \n\nviolence once and for all. Along the way, the temperamental hero is joined by \n\nfellow mutants John Wraith (Will.i.Am) and Remy LeBeau (aka Gambit, played by \n\nTaylor Kitsch).
