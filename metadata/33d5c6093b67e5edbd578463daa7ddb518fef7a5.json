She claimed: &quot;I was trying to project manage my studio, and the house and moving in never having done anything like that before is EXTREMELY stressful. [...] I was so stressed out. So my friend rang me up and said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI never see you anymore, why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you come down, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not making the record yet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ come downÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. So I went down to Brighton and all the way on the train I was making phone calls, and I wanted to just be back home working on it. [...] So we went out this festival ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it was good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but being around music made me even more jittery like I should be doing more and getting home. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really have a good night really. I was trying so hard to be into the night and they were all nice people and everything but I just wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t into it, but I just couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t escape and I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get home and it was too late and lived three hours away. So I was stuck [...] Literally, you just want to scream and slap everyone around (not really slapping everyone around - joking), but you know you just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to be there. Panic attack set in. Cold sweats. And I just wanted to get on the first train home basically. I did eventually ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ got the first train home, stayed up all night and wrote the song on the piano at home really quickly. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lovely about it is that I recorded the song in the studio which is directly underneath the dining room where the piano is. And then yesterday [says very excitedly], I filmed the video for it which is where I wrote the song!&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d5c6093b67e5edbd578463daa7ddb518fef7a5","amp;dn":"Imogen+Heap+-+First+Train+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d5c6093b67e5edbd578463daa7ddb518fef7a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,213,198,9,59,103,229,237,189,87,132,99,218,167,221,181,24,254,247,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
