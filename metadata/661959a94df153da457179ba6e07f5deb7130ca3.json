Without drivers you wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to print a document, read this webpage or connect to the Internet. All hardware elements in your PC, including your graphics and sound card, your motherboard, your hard disk, your modem or even your keyboard, come with drivers. Initially these may have come preinstalled with the operating system, or you may have installed them from the manufacturerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CD. However the manufacturers will since have improved these drivers by removing bugs and adding extra features or functionality. This means that unless you update your drivers regularly you may face any of a range of problems, from the relatively minor, such as hardware that seems buggy and poorly performing, to the more major such as hardware failures, conflicts and complete system crashes.\n\nThe Solution\n\nWith so many drivers installed on your system you cannot reasonably keep track of which drivers have been updated, which is why you need driver update management software to help out. Driver Scanner is the perfect solution for automatically updating drivers, saving you the hassle of having to identifying all your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drivers, then find updates for them using, before then downloading them from the manufacturerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s website. Driver Scanner scans your PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drivers and checks them against our comprehensive library of the latest drivers, to give you a full list of all those that need to be updated. With single click simplicity Driver Scanner will then install each update on your PC. But whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more, Driver Scanner will also backup all your drivers to an external device, meaning that the next time you reinstall your system you can load up all your latest drivers, from one place.\n\nHome Page - http://www1.uniblue.com/pc/ub/google/uniblue-offers/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661959a94df153da457179ba6e07f5deb7130ca3","amp;dn":"Uniblue+DriverScanner+2011+4.0.1.6+Multilanguage+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661959a94df153da457179ba6e07f5deb7130ca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,25,89,169,77,241,83,218,69,113,121,186,110,7,245,222,183,19,12,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
