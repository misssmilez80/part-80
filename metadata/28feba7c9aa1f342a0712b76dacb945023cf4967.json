Fung (Patrick Se Yin), a crippled former soccer star, coaches ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMighty Steel LegÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sing (Stephen Chow) to lead an unlikely soccer team of fellow former monks against his rival HungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (Patrick Tse) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTeam EvilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ soccer team. The gentle love affair that develops between Sing and baker/kung fu expert Mui (Vicki Zhao) pays off big when the shy Mui joins SingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soccer team to assist against ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTeam Evil.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShaolin SoccerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a playful celebration of Hong Kong Kung Fu movie cliches that employs a madcap recipe of satire, humor and action to a winning end. \n\n\n\nPlease seed and comment ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28feba7c9aa1f342a0712b76dacb945023cf4967","amp;dn":"Shaolin+-+Soccer+-+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28feba7c9aa1f342a0712b76dacb945023cf4967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,254,186,124,154,161,243,66,160,113,43,118,218,203,148,80,35,207,73,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
