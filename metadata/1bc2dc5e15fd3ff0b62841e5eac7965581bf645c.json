I call in MixAmix 2010 because it came from 4 unfinished mixes I tried to do in 2010 but none of these was satisfying enough for my taste.\nFinally last month the pieces came together and the puzzle was glued. And it came out nicelly. At last I have in my hands a new driving mix tested on the streets.\nAs usual you will find out that I am unable to stick to one kind of music and I hope those who are like me will enjoy this.\nYou will also find many nice surprises as I have stick together various remixes of the same songs to create something new.\nI start with Eminem - No Love (djmentzik mixamix version) then Chicane - Poppiholla (djmentzik mixamix version) and a small remix to Alison Moyet - A Guy Like You (djmentzik dangerous retouched).\nGuess you will find from where the samples come from. Later in the mix you will meet one of the songs which had tremendous impact in 2010, the HURTS - Wonderful Life (djmentzik mixamix version) followed by Rainbow - Since Youve Been Gone.\nAnd after a while David Guetta - Memories (meets Fatboy Slim djmentzik remix) gives respect to the godfather. The last retouched song in this mix is the most uplifting Laurent Wolf - Seventies (djmentzik mixamix version) which leads us to the outro with the amazingand best version of David Guetta &amp; Chris Willis Feat. Fergie &amp; LMFAO - Gettin Over You.\n\nAs always I hope you will share my excitement for music that can accompany you to highway or countryside explorations.\n\nKeep travelling, sharing music and have fun!\n\nDj Mentzik (2011).\n\n\nDJ MENTZIK - MIXAMIX 2010 playlist\n\n(27 tracks / playing time: 81minutes 21seconds)\n\t\n* Eminem - No Love (djmentzik mixamix version)\n01.
