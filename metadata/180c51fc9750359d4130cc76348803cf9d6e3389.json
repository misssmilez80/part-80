Even with a low audio\n\t\t   bitrate, 233MB would have yielded little over 800kbps video. There\n\t\t   are many high-motion and high-detail scenes in this docu movie. It's \n\t\t   not a scripted TV show. I also checked against the dvd encoding\n\t\t   standards. 25fps * 35mins * 0.28 = 245 which would put it at 350MB\n\n***************************************************************************************\n\nOfficial Website.: http://womanrebelfilm.com/\n\t\t  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/woman-rebel/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/woman-rebel/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDB Link........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1507392/\nIMDB Rating......: 7.0/10\nSynopsis.........: Over the course of a ten year revolution in Nepalnearly 40% of the \n\t\t   guerillas who joined the rebel army were women.  WOMAN REBEL follows \n\t\t   the story of one such woman, Uma Bhujel (army codename Silu) from \n\t\t   the jungles of revolution all the way through to the halls of \n\t\t   Parliament. Having been propelled to join by witnessing gender \n\t\t   inequality in her childhood, Silu fought on the opposite side of the \n\t\t   war against her brother.  However, it is ultimately peaceful protest \n\t\t   by Silu and her party that bring about the upheaval of government \n\t\t   that they seek. Set against the backdrop of Nepals tumultuous \n\t\t   history over the past 10 years; WOMAN REBEL promises to be a unique \n\t\t   and personal portrait journeying from revolution to peace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180c51fc9750359d4130cc76348803cf9d6e3389","amp;dn":"Woman.Rebel.2010.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180c51fc9750359d4130cc76348803cf9d6e3389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,12,81,252,151,80,53,157,65,48,204,118,52,136,3,207,157,110,51,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
