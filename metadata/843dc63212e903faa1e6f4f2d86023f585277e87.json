And his goal is to take whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true and twist it. Take peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s view of God and twist it just enough that people become angry with God, make decisions based on that anger, and blame Him for the consequences of their actions.\n\nSession three, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSays Who,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ addresses our tendency to rebel against authority. When confronted by authority, we evaluate what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re being asked to do ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and if we disagree with it, we ignore it. But, Stanley contends, obedience is not about the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhat,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but about the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhom,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because there is no authority except that which God has established, whether we like it or not.\n\nSession four, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFacing Forward,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ examines suffering, and how we cannot understand the purpose of suffering if we only examine our present circumstances rather than looking at the larger context that God has given us to understand it.\n\nSession five, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Only Physical,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is all about sex ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ what our culture says, and how itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s destroying our potential for intimacy as it focuses on sex as an activity rather than an intimate experience that is for a married couple only. And when sex is taken out of its intended context, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incredibly destructive.\n\nSession six, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s No Mistake,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ confronts our attitude toward our ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmistakesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the things we do that we know are wrong, but we try to dumb down rather than admit that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re sin. And if we only make mistakes, we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sin. And if we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sin, we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need a Savior. We only have to do better.\nReactions\n\nWithout a doubt, this is a curriculum that will challenge, and, most likely, anger many of the men and women in the group youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re leading. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very good thing.\n\nOver the last several years, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been such a strong de-emphasis on sin, authority and a real Satan, to the point that on a practical level, many of us deny that they exist. Rather than being sinners, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmistakers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a bogeymanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½certainly thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a real enemy of our souls whose desire is to kill and destroy? ArenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we all getting bent out of shape about sex; I mean, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only a natural activityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ right?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nWhile every lesson is sure to be challenging to everyone to differing degrees, I believe that the third and sixth lessons will weigh heavily on many (I know they did for me).\n\nLesson three, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSays Who,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is all about authority. And because many of us secretly (or not so secretly) hate authority, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s difficult to hear the truth that when we disobey themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if we disobey our parents, we ignore our boss, reject the counsel of our pastors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re actually disobeying God.\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a big deal, and really hits me where I live, because I struggle in this area.\n\nLesson six will also be troubling for many because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, in essence, a lesson on the doctrine of sin. And Stanley rightly points out that if weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not sinners, we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t actually need a Savior.\n\nThese are lessons that kill pride, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m grateful for them.\nThe other things I loved\n\nThe Additional Resources: These are incredibly helpful! Providing leaders with resources to advertise and personally invite friends, family and church members is brilliant.\n\nThe LeaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guide is very thorough and accessible for a leader of any ability to handle. The questions are very open and allow for much discussion, and leaders are provided with speaking points to help guide the conversation should it go off course.\n\nThe complete sermon series is available on the disc. Group leaders: Watch the full sermons before you start this study! TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll add an incredible amount of depth to your discussion.\nWas there anything I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like?\n\nOverall, the teaching overall was very thorough, very biblical and very helpful. There were a few places here and there where IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d push on StanleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interpretation, but nothing really concerned me or struck me as unprofitable. If I had to quibble, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d say that the opening sequences featuring the CTU (Concept Twisting Unit) were a bit cheesy, but they still helped to illustrate the point of each lesson.\nConclusion\n\nThis video series is one I would encourage any group to use with little hesitation. The content is heavy and sometimes difficult to listen to, but will surely benefit all in your group who have ears to hear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:843dc63212e903faa1e6f4f2d86023f585277e87","amp;dn":"Andy+Stanley+-+Twisting+the+truth+DVD+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"843dc63212e903faa1e6f4f2d86023f585277e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,61,198,50,18,233,3,250,161,230,244,242,216,96,35,245,133,39,126,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
