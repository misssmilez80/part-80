Child Rights legislation came into force making it illegal to brand children as witches and some pastors were arrested.\n\nFinancial support also poured in to assist a small British charity providing the only safe refuge for hundreds of youngsters attacked after claims that they were possessed by the Devil.\n\nIn Return to Africa's Witch Children, Dispatches reveals what happened to some of the children and church leaders who originally featured, and discovers that even now children as young as two are still being stigmatized as witches and treated as outcasts.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-43/episode-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-43/episode-1&lt;/a&gt; edits\n\nSource: http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=100468\nCap: evil-koala\nOther shunster posts\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f855a84eb04a8c2a51bd0f919eb328a5eb223639","amp;dn":"Dispatches+-+Africa%5C%27s+Witch+Children+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+23-11-2009+11+23+Cha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f855a84eb04a8c2a51bd0f919eb328a5eb223639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,85,168,78,176,74,140,42,81,189,15,145,158,179,40,165,235,34,54,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
