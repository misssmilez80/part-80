If you could only punch       \n    them so they stay quiet... Now you can! New iPhone game Bird Reflex   \n    lets you test your reflexes by punching those crazy twittering        \n    birds... See how fast your reactions are in two game modes: In        \n    Reflex Mode there will be 10 birds randomly falling from the tree.    \n    Your goal is to punch the bird as soon as she leaves the tree but     \n    not too early and not too late, because there will be penalties. In   \n    Time Mode you have to keep little worm alive as long as you can.      \n    Every birdie you don't punch will bite the worm a little. If you're   \n    really really fast you'll gain various game achievements. Happy       \n    punching!
