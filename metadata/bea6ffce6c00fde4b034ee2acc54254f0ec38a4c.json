It is set to have the album version, a Radio edited version, titled &quot;Armageddon&quot; and a remix by the Teddybears. The album was released for download on May 5, 2009, along with the pre-order of The High End of Low.\n\nMarilyn Manson says about the song on June's Revolver issue:\n\n    ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the song that I 100%, absolutely would never believe a record company would want to release as a single. Half the point of writing it was just to piss them off. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the type of thing that comes out of my mouth on a regular basis. Some people think I have a chromosome disorder in my brain, so I make up words and phrases that are ridiculous. I say itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsuperhero special feature.&quot;\n\nBehind the scene photos of the video being filmed show that the video may be similar to the Antichrist Superstar video/live performances. Showing Manson singing at a podium only instead of the shock symbol it seems to show what resembles a dollar sign. The video was directed by Delaney Bishop. On May 14, the video premiered on NME.com.\n\nOn May 28, 2009, the edited version of the video was available for download on iTunes.\n\nThe High End of Low is the seventh studio album by Marilyn Manson. Sean Beavan, who mixed Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals, and Eat Me, Drink Me, is co-producer of the album along with Chris Vrenna. The album was released on May 25 2009 in the United Kingdom and May 26, 2009 in the United States. The album's first radio single &quot;Arma-***damn-Mother******-Geddon&quot; was released on May 18, 2009. Reviews were mixed, with some criticizing the repetitiveness of the music and lacklustre ideas, while others praised a more human Manson following his divorce, and a return to the sound of the well-received Mechanical Animals. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard charts, falling to number 24 and 60 on its second and third weeks.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea6ffce6c00fde4b034ee2acc54254f0ec38a4c","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+Arma-%2A%2A%2Adamn-mother%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A-geddon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea6ffce6c00fde4b034ee2acc54254f0ec38a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,166,255,206,108,0,253,228,176,52,238,42,204,84,37,79,14,195,138,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
