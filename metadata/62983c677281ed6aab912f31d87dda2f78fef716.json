Quay also allows you to make folder    \n    proxy icons with easily customized icons.                             \n                                                                          \n    So why should you use Quay at all? Extra information, more            \n    flexibility. For one, the Dock's popups are limited to about 500      \n    items; Quay's limit is in the tens of thousands. You can have a       \n    Quay popup on both sides of the Dock; Apple has them only on the      \n    document side. The Dock doesn't follow aliases/symbolic links in      \n    its menus; Quay does. It works for Smart Folders, also shows          \n    application versions and (for running applications) CPU and memory    \n    statistics. Still, if for some reason you want the Dock's normal      \n    display, just hold the Option key down before clicking.               \n                                                                          \n    Quay is a simple-to-use Cocoa application. You can run it just to     \n    configure a popup item in the Dock, but it works automatically        \n    with your existing stacks; the actual popup is handled by a           \n    background process that uses few system resources. The Dock icons     \n    can be customized for better recognition (and put on both sides of    \n    the Dock).                                                            \n                                                                          \n    Quay does no magic. It doesn't hack the Dock in any way, and calls    \n    no private system interfaces.                                         \n                                                                          \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.brockerhoff.net/quay/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.brockerhoff.net/quay/index.html&lt;/a&gt;                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Use our keymaker to register the application.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
