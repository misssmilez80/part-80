This is a vinyl rip of the original movie score from Warner Brothers records. i wish the LP was in better condition. I am still looking for one in better condition and if i find one, i will remaster it and post a new torrent. I did my best to remove all the clicks in the LP that i could...but you can think of the clicks as a rustic and classic and nostalgic sound.\n\nI hope you enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63de2da371a78b221534b8b0366befe70e7f6527","amp;dn":"Fistful+of+Dollars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63de2da371a78b221534b8b0366befe70e7f6527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,222,45,163,113,167,139,34,21,52,184,176,54,107,239,231,14,127,101,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
