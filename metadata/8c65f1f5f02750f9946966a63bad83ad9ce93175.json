New Converts Will Have A Hard Time Identifying The Lovelorn Folk Singer Of White Ladder In The Sleek Surroundings Here, But Sell Sell Sell Still Offers Detectable Snatches Of Emerging Talent In The Soft-Spoken &quot;Gutters Full Of Rain,&quot; In The Straight-Laced Rock Of &quot;Everytime,&quot; And In The Curiously Poignant &quot;Late Night Radio.&quot; Ultimately, It's Enticing, If Not Essential.\n\n*** I Bought the disc in a casing without covers and I downloaded the front and back covers from allcdcovers.com.\n\t\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Faster, Sooner, Now  \n[02] Late Night Radio.  \n[03] Sell, Sell, Sell  \n[04] Hold On To Nothing  \n[05] Everytime  \n[06] Magdalena  \n[07] Smile  \n[08] Only The Lonely  \n[09] What Am I Doing Wrong?  \n[10] Gutters Full Of Rain  \n[11] Forever Is Tomorrow Is Today  \n[12] Folk Song  \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:53m:49s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 124mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I- Tunes v7.5.0.20 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Rock Folk\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 16 April 1996\n\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.davidgray.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/DavidGray \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/David+Gray \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems, Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents 2 Check * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c65f1f5f02750f9946966a63bad83ad9ce93175","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+Sell+Sell+Sell+-+David+Gray+-+124mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c65f1f5f02750f9946966a63bad83ad9ce93175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,101,241,245,240,39,80,249,148,105,102,166,59,173,131,173,156,233,49,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
