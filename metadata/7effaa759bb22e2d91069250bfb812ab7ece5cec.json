The only constants have been Weasel and guitarist John Jughead, but First World ManifestoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Screeching WeaselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album since 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forgettable Teen Punks In HeatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½finds Weasel without Jughead for the first time. He and frequent Screeching Weasel guitarist/bassist Dan Vapid are quick to note that Jughead never wrote any music, so his absenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½following a lengthy legal disputeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t noteworthy.\n\nFans would likely disagree if First World Manifesto werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Screeching WeaselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best album since its early-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢90s heyday. Well producedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a rarity in the Weasel discographyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by The All-American RejectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Mike Kennerty, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full of catchy, concise songs nicely layered with backup vocals, organ, and subtle flourishes. The album works because of the many moments where the elements align perfectly: the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature simple guitar lead synching with the organ in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrankengirlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; WeaselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals and the guitar at the end of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThree Lonely DaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; the backup vocals in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeginningless Vacation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nLyrically, Ben Weasel remains crankier than ever, with his contempt for the scene that sustains him informing much of the album. He intended the opener, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFollow Your Leaders,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to be a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpoke in the eyeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for punk scenestersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½though Fat Wreck Chords owner Fat Mike sees it more as a personal digÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the theme continues on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFriday Night NationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLittle Big ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which mentions Fat Mike by name). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a little wearying, mostly because Weasel doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t realize thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing bold about mocking scenesters, hipsters, or other caricatures. But no Screeching Weasel fan expects nuance from Ben Weasel. Fortunately, what fans do expectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½catchy, clever, anthemic pop-punk songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½First World Manifesto has in spades.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7effaa759bb22e2d91069250bfb812ab7ece5cec","amp;dn":"Screeching+Weasel+-+First+World+Manifesto+-+320kbps+VINYL+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7effaa759bb22e2d91069250bfb812ab7ece5cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,255,170,117,155,178,46,45,145,6,146,80,191,184,18,171,126,206,92,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
