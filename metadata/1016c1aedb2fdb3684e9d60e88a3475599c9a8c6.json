Which meant that I had to go through alot of folders and copy each one .... one folder at a time.\n\n\nVersion 2 now includes option for determine the image sizes. This way we don't copy/move all the crappy banners or thumbnails and such.\n\n\nRequirements: .NET 3.5 + some additional V2.0 Frameworks but I figure that most people have updated their windows within the last couple of years. Otherwise, if you get an error then just update your windows.\n\nIf you meet the above requirements then No Install Needed.\n\n\nDeveloper: 114 Dasma Software, Philippines\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://114-software.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://114-software.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1016c1aedb2fdb3684e9d60e88a3475599c9a8c6","amp;dn":"MoveCopyJpg+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1016c1aedb2fdb3684e9d60e88a3475599c9a8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,22,193,174,219,47,219,54,132,233,214,14,136,163,71,85,153,201,168,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
