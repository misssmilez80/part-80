It was the most-added song on Modern Rock Radio in its first week of release and peaked at number sixteen on the US Modern Rock chart. The song was certified gold as a digital single on December 13, 2005. It is the band's third most successful song, behind previous hits &quot;Meant to Live&quot; and &quot;Dare You to Move&quot;.\n\nThe music video for this song was filmed at Universal Studios mostly underwater. The video features the band playing in an outdoor setting, but as the video progresses, they can be seen &quot;floating&quot; in a watery environment. At the apex of the song right before the bridge of the song, this environment bursts and the band plays in the rain until the end of the video. \n\nAccording to the song-writer Jon Foreman, &quot;Stars&quot; is about perspective, a song about stepping back in the midst of chaos and looking at the stars; the idea of anti-entropy, implying there must be something keeping the world together. &quot;The first verse looks at things from Descartes perspective, pinning the center of the universe on the individual. 'Maybe I've been the problem,' maybe I'm overcast, falling apart, etc... The second verse talks about our world from the perspective of the stars looking down on earth from the eternal dance of gravity and motion.&quot;\n\nNothing Is Sound is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Switchfoot. It is often cited as the greatest of the Switchfoot albums, being a near-unanimous fan-favorite.  It was released on September 13, 2005, and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. The first single from this album was &quot;Stars,&quot; which was the number one most-added song on Modern Rock Radio, and received much airplay on alternative rock stations upon release. A second single &quot;We Are One Tonight&quot; was released in early 2006, but without much success on the Billboard charts.\n\nThe album was marred by major controversy over the inclusion of XCP copy protection distributed on all copies of the disc. This led to bassist Tim Foreman posting a detailed work-around on the band's website (which was promptly removed by Columbia Records). Nothing Is Sound was at the forefront of the Sony BMG CD copy prevention scandal, which eventually led to the recall of all CD's that contained the protection.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48f4e45cdbc5de991986d40172f7f26c48d2c853","amp;dn":"Switchfoot+-+Stars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48f4e45cdbc5de991986d40172f7f26c48d2c853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,244,228,92,219,197,222,153,25,134,212,1,114,247,242,108,72,210,200,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
