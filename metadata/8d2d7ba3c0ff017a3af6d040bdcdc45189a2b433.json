Two songs add Fusako Yoshikda on koto. The performances (mostly Osby originals) are complex, somewhat abrasive, and in the M-Base genre, swinging in their own funky fashion and following a different logic than bebop. Osby plays quite well, and the music grows in interest with each listen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2d7ba3c0ff017a3af6d040bdcdc45189a2b433","amp;dn":"Greg+Osby+And+Sound+Theatre+-+Greg+Osby+And+Sound+Theatre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2d7ba3c0ff017a3af6d040bdcdc45189a2b433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,45,123,163,192,255,1,122,58,246,208,64,189,205,196,81,137,162,180,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
