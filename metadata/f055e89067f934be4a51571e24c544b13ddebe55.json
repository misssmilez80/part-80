He is regarded by critics as one of the finest suspense novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. His 1951 debut, the pulp paperback novel Hill Girl, sold over a million copies. A dozen of his books have been adapted for the screen, most popularly Dead Calm.\n  --Wikipedia\n\n  River Girl is the story of Jack Marshall, who's working as a deputy sheriff in a small southern town of the kind Williams writes about so well. \n  Jack didn't set out to become corrupt. It just happened gradually, and even at that, we know he's not all bad. He just needs a chance to escape from the life he's trapped in. And the woman of the title, Doris, seems to be the way out he's been looking for. But if you're familiar with Williams's work, you know that things seldom go well for his protagonists, and this time is no exception. \n  First, somebody is killed. Then, although Jack seems to have a perfect plan, little things start going wrong. One of the pleasures of reading the book is to find out what these little things are. Williams is a terrific plotter, so while you may guess some of them, I doubt you'll guess all of them. The final chapter, only two pages long, is just right. Couldn't be improved upon. The tone, pacing, and atmosphere of the whole book are pitch-perfect. No wonder River Girl is one of my favorite Charles Williams books.\n  --Bill Crider","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f055e89067f934be4a51571e24c544b13ddebe55","amp;dn":"Charles+Williams+-+River+Girl+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f055e89067f934be4a51571e24c544b13ddebe55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,85,232,144,103,249,52,190,74,81,87,30,36,197,68,177,61,222,190,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
