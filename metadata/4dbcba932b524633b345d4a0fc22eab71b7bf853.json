Frontiersman Vern Haskell (Arthur Kennedy) wanders throughout the West in search of the man who robbed and murdered his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e. He is told that he'll probably find the culprits at Chuck-a-Luck, a combination horse ranch and criminal hideout overseen by saloon chanteuse Altar Keane (Marlene Dietrich). To gain entrance to Chuck-a-Luck, Haskell poses as an escaped prisoner. Keane warns him that the ranch has only one rule: &quot;Don't ask questions.&quot; Still, he has ways of finding things out. Haskell is compelled to keep up his charade when the dirty denizens of Chuck-a-Luck plan a big bank holdup, but this has the result of exposing the killer of his girl. Director Fritz Lang had a rough time with RKO head Howard R. Hughes, who insisted upon making changes in the film that might have hurt it irreparably. The biggest argument centered over the title; Hughes complained that no one overseas would understand the meaning of Chuck-a-Luck, whereupon Lang riposted sarcastically that &quot;I'm sure that everyone will understand Rancho Notorious.&quot; One of the principal villains was Lloyd Gough, but you'd never know it from the opening titles; Hughes, incensed that Gough had refused to testify at the HUAC &quot;witch hunt,&quot; ordered that the blacklisted Gough's name be removed from the credits. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045070/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045070/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-45070/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-45070/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:29:03\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x480 1.37:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 2152 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,29 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbcba932b524633b345d4a0fc22eab71b7bf853","amp;dn":"Rancho+Notorious+%281952%29+Marlene+Dietrich+-+Arthur+Kennedy+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbcba932b524633b345d4a0fc22eab71b7bf853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,188,186,147,43,82,70,51,179,69,212,160,252,34,234,183,27,123,248,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
