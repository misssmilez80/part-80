While closely allied with soul and R&amp;B, each tune on THE LIVE EXPERIENCE is ultimately centered on a Christian theme. Recorded at the Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, this album features fellow gospel crooners Kirk Franklin, LaShun Pace, and Fred Hammond. Moreover, a smoking-hot horn section (performing arrangements by Lloyd Barry) accompanies the funky rhythm section.\n\nOn THE LIVE EXPERIENCE, the Allen brothers sing a mixture of new and classic material. The group's R&amp;B hit &quot;I Belong to You&quot; is particularly inspired. This track includes smooth vocal harmonies, jazzy chords, and sudden punctuations from the brass section. &quot;Something About the Name Jesus&quot; is a newer tune that focuses on the ascendancy of Christ. On this piece, Franklin preaches over the mellow doo-wop stylings of the brothers Allen. This concert recording offers 13 electrifying tracks for fans of R&amp;B-flavored gospel. It also proves that Rance Allen and company still have what it takes to really charm audiences.\n\nRance Allen: Rance Allen (vocals); Terry Faison (guitar); Courtney Dwight (organ, programming); Chris Byrd, Nicholas Allen, Gordon Henry.\n\nPersonnel: Vincent Chandler, Lloyd Barry (horns); Courtney Dwight (organ, drum programming); Chris Byrd (keyboards); Gordon Henry (bass guitar); Nicholas Allen (drums); John &quot;Buddy&quot; Williams (background vocals).\n\nAudio Mixer: Steve Capp.\n\nRecording information: Greater Grace Temple, Detroit, MI.\n\nPhotographer: Paul Thomas .\n\nAdditional personnel: Fred Hammond, Kirk Franklin, LaShun Pace (vocals).\n\nNew Orleans Jazz Festival\n\nLocal Favorites\nAmanda Shaw - Good Southern Girl\nJohn Boutte - Good Neighbor\n\nGospel Singers\n\n\nCanton Gospel Soul Children - Welcome to Canton\nConnie &amp; Dwight Fitch with The Family - Victory in Jesus\nNew Orleans Tribute to Mahalia Jackson - Cynthia Girtly &amp; Dr Michael White\nShades of Praise - God is Still Doing Great Things\nThe Electrifying Crown Seekers - Thank You For Saving Me\nThe Melody Clouds - Great Day\nThe Zion Harmonizers - The Best of New Orleans Gospel\n\nThere are also several hundred Festival Photos and some Short RAW Video Clips\n\n\nPOtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 99 - The Biggest Conspiracy of all time. Solved\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nPOtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 99 - The Greatest Conspiracy of All Times - Solved\n- NO MORE DOUBTS - Coming Soon\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nThis is what is coming and more. If you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
