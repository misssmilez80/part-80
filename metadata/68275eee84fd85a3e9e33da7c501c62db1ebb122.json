The song was written by Urban, Charlotte Caffey, and Jane Wiedlin.\n\nThe third single release from his album Keith Urban, &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot; became Urban's first No. 1 single on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart on February 24, 2001; the song spent one week at No. 1. The song also includes a video, which has aired on CMT and GAC.\n\nWhen &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot; reached No. 1, it marked the first time that non-American artists had back-to-back chart-topping songs; the song replaced &quot;There Is No Arizona&quot; by Jamie O'Neal, and both artists are Australian.\n\nBoth radio-edit and album-length versions have been issued. The radio edit excises a musical bridge after the second chorus and has a slightly different ending than the album cut.\n\nKeith Urban is the second solo album by Australian country singer Keith Urban , released on October 19, 1999.\n\nCertified platinum in the United States, the album was Urban's breakthrough album in that country. Prior to this album, he had recorded a self-titled album in Australia in 1991, and another in the U.S. as a member of the short-lived band The Ranch. Keith Urban produced four singles for Urban on the Billboard country charts. In order of release, these were: &quot;It's a Love Thing&quot; (#18), &quot;Your Everything&quot; (#4), &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot; (#1), and &quot;Where the Blacktop Ends&quot; (#3). &quot;A Little Luck of Our Own&quot; was originally titled &quot;Luck Of Our Own&quot; and recorded by singer-songwriter Dale Daniel on her 1994 album Luck Of Our Own.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68275eee84fd85a3e9e33da7c501c62db1ebb122","amp;dn":"Keith+Urban+-+But+For+The+Grace+Of+God+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68275eee84fd85a3e9e33da7c501c62db1ebb122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,39,94,238,132,253,133,163,233,227,61,167,197,1,198,45,177,235,177,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
