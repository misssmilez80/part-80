Battery fails? Unlock fails? You need purplesn0w, the geohot 3GS unlock solution. Now I know you here a lot about different colors of sn0w, but I'm here to tell you why purplesn0w is the best. First off, what is purplesn0w? It's a soft unlock for your 3GS that I'd actually use day to day. It's not a daemon that takes any resources, and it doesn't add a task to your baseband. It's very close to a true unlock. All it does is patch three files, CommCenter, lockdownd, and your wildcard activation plist(which you need, activate w at&amp;t sim first, no hacktivation support yet). That's it, no other files are installed. Props to Oranav for the at+xlog exploit!\nA full explanation is coming soon, but I think you clever reversers out there will see what it does, and see why it's so pristine :-) The payload is radically different from other varieties of sn0w. beta as usual, back up first.\n\nBe sure to have legit activated 3GS\nDisable 3G if you don't have it(like T-Mobile).\nAdd apt.geohot.com to Cydia\nInstall com.geohot.purplesn0w\nWatch for success output in Cydia\nReboot, and enjoy your unlocked iPhone\n\n\nwww.sweunlockers.com free is our way of living","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bccf100400aee5cfa3e82e5e156ba16ddf3a76e4","amp;dn":"iPhone+3GS+Unlock+that+fix+wifi+and+battery+problems%2C+from+other","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bccf100400aee5cfa3e82e5e156ba16ddf3a76e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,207,16,4,0,174,229,207,163,232,46,94,21,107,161,109,223,58,118,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
