I took pictures of my 32' LCD TV using a 7.2 MP digital camera.  I took over 200 pictures and only these 26 came out looking halfway decent.  I cropped them and adjusted colors, contrast, brightness, etc. until I thought they were acceptable.  Unfortunately there is still some loss of quality, but I did my best.  They are still in very high resolution, so they are about 650 KB-1 MB each.  \n\nThis is only the first round of pics.  I plan on going back through and trying to get good pics of all the ones I missed.  I took all these at night, so I think if I try again during the day I will get different results.  Enjoy, and please comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67a96c9e8ed3e3929d1a2b710b9bac5d9d5c5536","amp;dn":"BlazBlue+Gallery+Artwork+Rebel+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67a96c9e8ed3e3929d1a2b710b9bac5d9d5c5536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,169,108,158,142,211,227,146,157,26,43,113,11,155,172,93,157,92,85,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
