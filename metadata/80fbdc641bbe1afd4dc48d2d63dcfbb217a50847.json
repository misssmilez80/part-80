My 3D TV will play .mkv files from a USB drive but the format needs to be specifically 1080p video with AC3 audio. This will also be the case for many other 3D TV owners out there. A lot of uploaded 3D content seems to have DTS audio and various video resolutions, which requires decoding to a playable format. So I thought I would upload my decoded content to save other users the headache, hassle and time. I have also decided to maintain a max movie/file size of 4GB to accommodate the use of a FAT32 formatted USB drive.\n\nVideo Stream\nCodec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)\nResolution: 1920x1080\nFrame Rate: 47.952431\n\nAudio Stream\nCodec: A52 Audio (aka AC3) (a52)\nLanguage: English\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz\nBitrate: 64 kb/s\n\nPlease help seed!\n\nCheers\n\nScreenshots:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80fbdc641bbe1afd4dc48d2d63dcfbb217a50847","amp;dn":"Cats+%26+Dogs+The+Revenge+of+Kitty+Galore+2010+3D+1080p+Half-SBS+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80fbdc641bbe1afd4dc48d2d63dcfbb217a50847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,251,220,100,27,190,26,253,77,196,141,45,99,220,251,178,23,165,8,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
