It is Mayer's first studio recorded single release since &quot;Say&quot; in 2007. On September 25, 2009, &quot;Who Says&quot; was released on John Mayer's official website.\n\nThe songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music video shows images of Mayer clubbing and dining out at night-time paired with scenes of him alone in his apartment, cleaning up and noodling on his guitar. Referencing the video, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly asked &quot;Who says the life of a rock star--sexy entourage, late-night pool parties, nubile young things dancing on banquettes--is just a mask for acoustic ennui? John Mayer, that's who,&quot; and gave the video a &quot;B&quot;.\n\nCritical reception of &quot;Who Says&quot; was mixed; though most praised the song musically, some were skeptical of Mayer's explicit reference to drug use. Crystal Bell of Billboard magazine gave a favorable review from the song, saying, &quot;'Who Says' balances Mayer's signature velvety tone with a more stripped-down, folk-inspired arrangement.&quot; She added, &quot;Mayer may not be speaking in grandiose terms about changing the world or marveling over a woman's beauty, but maybe that's the point.&quot; Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said of the single &quot;Mayer channels Cat Stevens, Jason Mraz, and every camp counselor you ever had on this soft-rockin' celebration of women, wild times, and getting stoned.&quot; and gave the song a &quot;B&quot;.\n\nOn the week ending October 31, 2009, &quot;Who Says&quot; debuted at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it his sixth top twenty hit and third highest-charting single on the Hot 100 to date. However, it also marks his lowest-charting single to date on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart, peaking at #19, thus snapping a recent streak of five consecutive singles to reach the Top Ten on the format. By the week ending November 21, 2009, the song had reached number one on Billboard's Triple A chart. With this single, Mayer tied Jack Johnson for most Triple A number ones (six) among male artists.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e76dabc2688a1f6c7b26aee9c74512c4f483f1ec","amp;dn":"John+Mayer+-+Who+Says++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e76dabc2688a1f6c7b26aee9c74512c4f483f1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,109,171,194,104,138,31,108,123,38,174,233,199,69,18,196,244,131,241,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
