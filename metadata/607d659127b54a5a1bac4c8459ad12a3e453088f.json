Protection...............Steam\nFPS..................Game Type ... Disk(s)....................DOX\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\nSanctum Update 2 info:\n\n\nChangelog 7053-&gt; 7062 HOT FIX\n\n- Fixed Save Game issues caused by 7053.\n- Reverted Mine layout for multi-player.\n\n\nSanctum Update 1 info:\n\n\nChangelog 6917-&gt; 7053\n\nWe are very happy to tell you that the Server Browser is finally \nhere. This should hopefully let ALL you who didn't manage to get \nport forwarding working to finally be able to play the game in \nmulti-player!\n\nTowers\n\n- Mortar level 5 AoE fixed\n- Anti-Air projectile turn speed increased slightly\n\nWeapons\n\n- The weapon will no longer become invisible when teleporting \n  switching weapon\n\nEnemies\n\n- Dealing less damage to Armoured than their armour value doesn't \n  lower the total damage done for the towers in the stat screen\n\nBuilding system\n\n- When aiming at a tower that can't be built on the current map, \n  it's now treated as aiming at a part of the world\n- Tower base hologram does not disappear when selling a tower \n  built in a previous build phase.\n\nLevels\n\n- Mine - added a lot of towerbases in multiplayer\n- Arc - added 4 towerbases\n- Arc - removed the towerbase underneath the level\n\nGeneral\n\n- Now updating Achievements stats at the beginning of the Build Phase.\n- You can no longer access the chat in the menu\n- The sound is no longer slowed down when restarting or exiting a \n  level while in a slow-field\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES\n\nThe patch has some issues. We did stress this out, as we believed you \nwanted to play as fast as possible.\n\n- Restart Game and New Game from Score Scene\n- We have not got this working correctly yet, thus they are disabled, \n  but it will be fixed soon.\n\nMine\n\n- There's been a change on Mine in multi-player where you can build your \n  own televators. Sadly we forgot to put in a &quot;Starting Televator&quot; why \n  you need to make sure that you build one before you start fighting or \n  you might not get back on the map if you fall down\n- Going from a Steam Game to a TCP/IP game\n- Can currently cause issues. You will need to restart Sanctum if you \n  decide to switch to TCP/IP after a Steam Game. Most of you won't use \n  TCP/IP thus you won't need to bother about this.\n\n\nThere's probably some more issues around, and these will be fixed. We \nwill also add filters to the search functions etc.\n\nHope you will enjoy the Server Browser! \n\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1. Unpack release\n2. Run Sanctum.Update.1.and.2.exe\n3. Install\n4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder to the main install\n   folder and overwrite\n5. Play the game\n6. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!\n\n\nGREETINGS\n\nUnleashed - TiNYiSO - MRN - RADIKAL - POSTMORTEM - GENESIS - SHOCK\nCRUDE - ReUnion - VACE - OUTLAWS - BACKLASH - Titan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607d659127b54a5a1bac4c8459ad12a3e453088f","amp;dn":"Sanctum.Update.1.and.2-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607d659127b54a5a1bac4c8459ad12a3e453088f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,125,101,145,39,181,74,90,27,172,76,132,89,173,18,163,228,83,8,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
