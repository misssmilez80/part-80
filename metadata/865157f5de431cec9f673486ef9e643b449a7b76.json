Timothy Hutton (Leverage) and Nick Cannon (Drumline) star among other recognizables who take part in a paid psychological study.  But unlike the cheap studies done to determine some wierd part of group dynamics in problem solving situations or other psychological BS ... this is a black-ops government psychological program.  But you'll just have to watch what happens in &quot;the Killing Room&quot; to find out the purpose of the study.\n\n\nTRIVIA:\n1.  The film runs on the premise that the old MK-ULTRA program of the CIA which studied mind control and chemical interrogation techniques is still running.  The original program was supposedly shut down in 1973, but rumors continue to abound that the program or some form of the original MK-ULTRA program has continued to run into present day.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
