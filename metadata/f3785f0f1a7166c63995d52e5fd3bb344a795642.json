Ashton, of course. Oprah, no doubt. Noush Skaugen? Really? \n\nUK indie rocker Noush Skaugen is definitely part of the twitter elite with 1,060,911 followers as of this moment (the number changes frequently). From her bio: An internationally touring artist, with a rapidly growing strong internet following, Noush has shared billing with acts such as TV On The Radio, Cold War Kids, REM, and the Stone Temple Pilots, Skaugen toured the US for the last two years, with TV appearances and radio interviews, throughout the West Coast, from Los Angeles to Nashville, Austin to Cincinatti, to the Southern cities of Starkville, Atlanta and New Orleans. No.1 Independent artist and No.25 on the Twitter Music Charts with the big boys (wefollow.com), Noush has squeezed in two albums and will release a third this spring. No serendipity for her, as a classically trained musician and songwriter, her audiences have delighted in her grounded and authentic style, her charisma and her electricity on stage. Skaugen's international background and multi-lingual ability, gives her the medium to connect with the world on a personal level. \n\nWebsite: http://noushskaugen.com/lost-and-found/ \n\nMyspace:\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/noushskaugen\n\nThe Indie Music Show is available on iTunes, Roku, etc. The main show link is here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theindiemusicshow.blip.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theindiemusicshow.blip.tv/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3785f0f1a7166c63995d52e5fd3bb344a795642","amp;dn":"Noush+Skaugen+Live+In+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3785f0f1a7166c63995d52e5fd3bb344a795642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,120,95,15,26,113,102,198,57,149,213,46,95,211,187,52,74,121,86,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
