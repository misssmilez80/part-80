Although just children themselves, these vagabonds adopt the baby, whom they name Mary Rose and become a most unlikely family. Longing for a fresh start, Adam, the eldest of the clan, inspires their migration out West where they eventually find the perfect site for the family homestead. Inspired by Julie Garwood's best-selling novel &quot;For the Roses,&quot; Jennifer Garner (Harvest of Fire) portrays Mary Rose, a vibrant and beautiful young woman who feels restricted by her overly protective brothers. When betrayal and heartbreak loosen the powerful bond of her adoptive family, her sorrow compels Mary Rose to search for her real parents in New York. Torn between two very different ways of life, Mary Rose must make the most important decision of her young life - to find where her true home really lies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e970909e8ba518e8a71dd4ed4ca11b0faf8292bb","amp;dn":"RoseHill.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e970909e8ba518e8a71dd4ed4ca11b0faf8292bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,112,144,158,139,165,24,232,167,29,212,237,76,161,27,15,175,130,146,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
