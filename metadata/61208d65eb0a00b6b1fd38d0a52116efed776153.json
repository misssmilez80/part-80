I have edited out the  \nmusic played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNOTES: Odd stuff today.  The first hour wasn't even broadcast over the web at the normal time.  Luckily the rebroadcast of hour 1 came through normally.  Well, I say normally, but all three hours had no web broadcast engineer again so I was able to just cut out the long silences.  The net is you hear the raw broadcast, only live commercials and the radio broadcast music.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61208d65eb0a00b6b1fd38d0a52116efed776153","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-06-08+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61208d65eb0a00b6b1fd38d0a52116efed776153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,32,141,101,235,10,0,182,177,253,56,208,165,33,22,239,237,119,97,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
