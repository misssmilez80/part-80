Each episode follows one tank's story: the rebuild; the innovations that made each machine great, and the engineering flaws that proved fatal. Unique serial numbers lead us to re-trace each tank's forged-in-war history: discovering where it was made, the battles it fought and the often tragic end of its fighting career. Once the hard work is over, we see the machines sputter and roar to life.\n\nDirector : PJ Naworynski\nExecutive Producer for Military Channel : Peter Rees\nAn Ellis Vision Production with Viasat Explorer, UKTV, Canwest and Military Channel (2009)\n\nEpisode 1 : The Centurion \nFast, smart, deadly, the British designed Centurion is one of the greatest tanks of all time. A champion in Korea against the Chinese Red Army, afterwards virtually every army in NATO wanted one. The Centurion is so adaptable that armies in South Africa and Israel are still using it. Even today, Centurion innovations live on in modern tanks.\n\nIn this episode, we will meet two crews working on Centurions. The first crew volunteers at the vast Imperial War Museum Duxford in England. They have all the time, spare parts and manpower they need. The second crew toils in a small museum in Oshawa, Canada. Relying on volunteer energy and miniscule budgets, they're aiming to get their Centurion finished in 10 years.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2133 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.792:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 48:52.080\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 854,833,152 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ca087809f37c941ad19171f7349b3290f1f444","amp;dn":"Military.Channel.Tank.Overhaul.Series2.1of4.The.Centurion.XviD.A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ca087809f37c941ad19171f7349b3290f1f444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,202,8,120,9,243,124,148,26,209,145,113,247,52,155,50,144,241,244,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
