This information is then saved within AI RoboForm, and when you need to fill a form, just click ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFill FormsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ button, and form is filled out. Being fully client-based AI RoboForm can be very fast, it never disables web site functions and AI RoboForm can also work in pop-up HTML windows. The most important feature of AI RoboForm is high accuracy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it fills 95% of all fields correctly.\n\nFeatures:\n\nAutoSave passwords in browser\nAutoFill passwords to login form\nClick Login button for you\nFill personal info into online forms\nSave offline passwords &amp; notes\nGenerate Secure Random Passwords\nEncrypt passwords and personal info using 3-DES\nAll personal info is stored on your computer only\nPut passwords on USB KeyChain for extra security\nSync your passwords and safenotes to a Palm\nBackup &amp; Restore, Print your passwords\n\nRelease Name: AI.Roboform.Enterprise.v7.3.0.0-TE\nSize: 15 MB\n\n\n INSTALLATION NOTES     \n\n        Install AiRoboForm-Enterprise.exe.  After installation make\n        sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer\n        windows are closed or else the file will not copy over properly\n        (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into safe mode if\n        you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll into AI Roboform's\n        installed folder, making sure to overwrite the existing file.  AI\n        Roboform is now in the full PRO version with Enterprise features.\n\n        We have included the Enterprise tool with this release so you\n        don't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the\n        PolicyEditor folder.\n\n        Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when\n        you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a\n        taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known\n        as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.\n        Its suggested to use a different RoboForm Everywhere password\n        than your master password.  This way nobody will be able to\n        decrypt your online database except you.\n\n        Thats it!  Enjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:616a737477881bb71b7dddccd78195fc1af3d38a","amp;dn":"AI+Roboform+Enterprise+v7.3.2.0-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"616a737477881bb71b7dddccd78195fc1af3d38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,106,115,116,119,136,27,183,27,125,221,204,215,129,149,252,26,243,211,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
