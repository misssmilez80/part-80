It is truly a landmark Heavy Metal album that bridged the classic heavy Rock of the 1970s and moved it into the slick and powerful 1980s with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pure metallic sound and commercial accessibility to FM airwaves. Look at all the classic songs that still get played on Classic Rock and current Rock radio: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Metal GodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Breaking The LawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Living After MidnightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“UnitedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m lucky here in Rhode Island because the local Rock station (94 WHJY) has one of the longest running Heavy Metal programs on Saturday nights called  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Metal ZoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard plenty of deeper tracks from BRITISH STEEL played over the years like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SteelerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GrinderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. I grew up with this album, I think I got it in 1983 officially but I had a dubbed cassette, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been one of my favorite albums by Judas Priest and of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s.\nNow BRITISH STEEL is 30 years oldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to believe! ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most of my life (IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m 38)! In order to celebrate such a milestone, Judas Priest toured last summer and played the entire album in order, then added a handful of Priest classics and rarities. I caught the show in Mansfield, MA on July 7th and it was a magnificent show, now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great to have a commorative document to enjoy it again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cde06e6a2a856635bbac57d019a0b3c9658942a","amp;dn":"Judas+Priest+-+Brittish+steel+30+Annivesary.+DL+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cde06e6a2a856635bbac57d019a0b3c9658942a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,222,6,230,162,168,86,99,91,186,197,125,1,154,11,60,150,88,148,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
