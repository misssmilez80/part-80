It held the number one spot for five straight weeks. The title track, &quot;Who's Zoomin' Who,&quot; has a more soulful bounce, including Franklin's delivery. Its sputtering bassline and chiming keyboards are augmented by Franklin's soulful delivery; her improvising ad libs are laudable to say the least. The single peaked at number two for four consecutive weeks. She had another Top Ten hit with &quot;Another Night,&quot; a mid-tempo number with a light rock feel. It was a number nine hit. Her duet with Eurythmics, &quot;Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves,&quot; faltered at number 66. This album has a slight pop texture. Narada Michael Walden is credited with the majority of the production on this sound outing.&quot; \n\nTRACK LIST\n\nWho's Zoomin' Who?\n==================\n\n01.
