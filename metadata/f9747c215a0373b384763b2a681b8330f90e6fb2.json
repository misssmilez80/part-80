Influenced early in life by circus and vaudeville performers who passed through his family's hotel in Nashville, Dave was exposed to many styles of performance and in 1885 he met banjo player Joel Davidson and became captivated by the instrument.  By the 1890s, Dave was entertaining stagecoach passengers with banjo tunes and comic antics from a homemade stage on the roof of the family's barn. \n\nUncle Dave Macon was one of the first country stars to record, the first star of the Grand Ole Opry, and one of the first members elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nPossibly one of the finest sets out.  If you want to really understand the depth of early country music, then you must have this set.  Macon had all the styles and showmanship that influenced everyone from Charlie Poole to Bill Monroe.  Every single song that was ever issued by Macon is contained on this set and the book is an incredible read. Most recommended! ~ Ben Dewberry\n\nThis is the best box set for the hardcore Uncle Dave Macon fan.  If you want to hear live tracks you have never had access to, and if you want to find out what the older tracks that were only released on 78 rpm are all about, you need this box!  The book is wonderful with newly found photos and a very detailed discography of the recordings! Probably, a little too rich for the casual fan. ~ M. Bailey\n\nPlease see for more information - Schon55 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUncle Dave Macon - Keep My Skillet Good &amp; Greasy CD 3 of 6 \n01  Ain't It A Shame To Keep Your Honey Out Of The Rain\n02  Stop That Knocking At My Door\n03  Sassy Sam\n04  Shout, Mourner, You Shall Be Free\n05  I Don't Care If I Never Wake Up\n06  In The Good Old Summer Time\n07  Something's Always Sure To Tickle Me\n08  Sourwood Mountain Medley\n09  Deliverance Will Come\n10  Wouldn't Give Me Sugar In My Coffee\n11  Kissin' On The Sly\n12  Hold On To The Sleigh\n13  In The Good Old Days Of Long Ago\n14  My Girl's A High Born Lady\n15  The Crossed Butcher And The Cackling Hen\n16  In The Old Carolina State (Where The Sweet Magnolias Bloom)\n17  Never Make Love No More\n18  Arcade Blues\n19  Them Two Gals Of Mine\n20  Diamond In The Rough\n21  Tossing The Baby So High\n22  Sho' Fly, Don't Bother Me\n23  Uncle Ned\n24  Braying Mule\n25  Bake That Chicken Pie\n26  Rock About My Sara Jane","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9747c215a0373b384763b2a681b8330f90e6fb2","amp;dn":"Uncle+Dave+Macon+-+Keep+My+Skillet+Good+%26+Greasy+CD+3+of+6+%281979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9747c215a0373b384763b2a681b8330f90e6fb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,116,124,33,90,3,115,179,132,118,59,42,104,27,131,48,249,14,111,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
