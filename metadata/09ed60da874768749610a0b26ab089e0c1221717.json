Real fruit, vegetables and meat are rare, expensive commodities, and much of the population survives on processed food rations, including &quot;soylent green&quot; wafers.\n\nThe film overlays the science fiction and police procedural genres as it depicts the efforts of New York City police detective Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) and elderly police researcher Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson) to investigate the brutal murder of a wealthy businessman named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten). Thorn and Roth uncover clues which suggest that it is more than simply a bungled burglary.\n\nThe film, which is loosely based upon the 1966 science fiction novel Make Room! Make Room!, by Harry Harrison, won the Nebula Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film in 1973.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ed60da874768749610a0b26ab089e0c1221717","amp;dn":"Soylent+Green+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ed60da874768749610a0b26ab089e0c1221717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,237,96,218,135,71,104,116,150,16,160,178,106,176,137,224,193,34,23,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
