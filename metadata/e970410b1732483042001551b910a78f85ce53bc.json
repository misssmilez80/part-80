Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her father (Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of Finland. Living a life unlike any other teenager, her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. The turning point in her adolescence is a sharp one; sent into the world by her father on a mission, Hanna journeys stealthily across Europe while eluding agents dispatched after her by a ruthless intelligence operative with secrets of her own (Ms. Blanchett). As she nears her ultimate target, Hanna faces startling revelations about her existence and unexpected questions about her humanity.\n\nCast:\nSaoirse Ronan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Hanna\nEric Bana ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Erik\nVicky Krieps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Johanna Zadek\nCate Blanchett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Marissa\nParis Arrowsmith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ CIA Tech #1\nJohn MacMillan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Lewis\nTim Beckmann ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Walt\nChristian Malcolm ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Head of Ops\nJamie Beamish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Burton\nTom Hodgkins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Monitor\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Mystery\nLanguage: English\nOriginal Source: TDP\nSize of MP4 file: 1.00 GB (1,077,915,648 bytes)\n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1220 kbps\nFramerate: 25.000 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution:720x304\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF) 0.223\n\nAudio Specifications:\n\nFormat: AAC-LC\nBitrate: AAC-LC = 128 kbps\nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 (Stereo)\nLanguage: English\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\nSubtitles: English &amp; Spanish\nSample: Yes\n\n\n\nPS3, POPCORN HOUR &amp; XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e970410b1732483042001551b910a78f85ce53bc","amp;dn":"Hanna+2011+R5+Line+A+Release-Lounge+H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e970410b1732483042001551b910a78f85ce53bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,112,65,11,23,50,72,48,66,0,21,81,185,16,167,143,133,206,83,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
