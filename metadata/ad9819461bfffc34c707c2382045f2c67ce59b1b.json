Five musicians, then in three separate bands, met through a local musician's message board. Lead singer Kevin Matisyn suggested the name, which refers to the dye that is injected into the bloodstream to measure blood volume, which he had read in one of his medical books. The band then caught the attention of producer Trevor Kustiak and his partner Mari Dew, of The Pocket Studios.\n\nThey recorded three demo songs, titled Black Hole, Saturnalia and Starlight, all of which were available on their personal MySpace page. At that time, updates on the bands' progress and prose by former lead singer, Kevin Matisyn were periodically given via the MySpace blogs.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.
