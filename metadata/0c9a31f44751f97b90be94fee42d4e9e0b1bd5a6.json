Human as well as professional. At home as well as abroad.  Jozef Psotka, nicknamed &quot;Juzek&quot;, or &quot;mountain worker&quot;.  One of the most notable figures of Slovak mountaineering.  A man who conquered the summit of Mount Everest. Now we have the chance to recall his noteworthy life, which was a great story of conquering the world's highest summits.\n\n\nZOLO DEMJÃƒï¿½N: &quot;I remember him as a training climber which, at that time, was not a common thing to do.&quot;\n\nIVAN FIALA: &quot;The fact that he trained a lot is well-known, but only a few people know that he studied a lot too.&quot;\n\nJUZEK PSOTKA: &quot;Up in the mountains, we, climbers, seem to be better people than when we are down-country. Maybe it's because of the mountains we love or because of the feeling of freedom between earth and sky. As if staying in the heights is like some kind of purgation for us, freeing us of the earth; as if we gain wings. Unfortunately, we put the wings aside on the way down.&quot;\n\n\nAbout K2 STUDIO Ltd.: \n\n     Ã‚Â· Adventure documentary films production \n     Ã‚Â· TV programmes production \n     Ã‚Â· Professional DVD production\n     Ã‚Â· TV spots production\n     Ã‚Â· DVD distribution\n     Ã‚Â· Slovakia and Slovak cinematography promotion \n     Ã‚Â· Rental of video equipment - DV and HDV technologies \n\n     K2 studio belongs to the leading Slovak production video studios.
