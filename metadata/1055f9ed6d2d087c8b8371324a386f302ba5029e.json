It is the most realistic Windows 7 theme out there. It all starts with the start bar of course! The start menu has a total of 14 icons, 6 of them are user defined. Also the start bar contains the text of icon 1 perfect for weather apps or Meterberry. Then there is a pop up window. By clicking/tapping the explorer icon in the start bar it brings up that window with 8 user defined icons. This also has icon 1 text for easy viewing of weather or battery percentage from Meterberry. Final the widgets on the right side of the screen are clock, media, my notes, and icon 1 on app screen. You can hide these icon my tapping the notification area on storm. Trackpad devices (X) hides the widgets and (Z) shows them.\n\n~*Comment*~ ~Enjoy~ ~*Seed*~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1055f9ed6d2d087c8b8371324a386f302ba5029e","amp;dn":"Blackberry+Torch+%28Premium+Windows+7+Theme%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1055f9ed6d2d087c8b8371324a386f302ba5029e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,85,249,237,109,45,8,124,139,131,113,50,74,56,111,48,43,165,2,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
