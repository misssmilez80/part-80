All killed by RCMP officers in British Columbia. And all RCMP constables involved in their deaths cleared -- without any criminal charges. \n\nInternal RCMP investigation reports obtained by W5 show that in all these cases the B.C. Attorney General's ministry had evidence that contradicted statements of the Mounties involved, yet chose not to prosecute them. Those decisions made by the B.C. Criminal Justice Branch have left the families of the victims wondering if the RCMP is beyond justice. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 45mn 14s 952ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English CA\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 932 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 134 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc94bb4fbff359614edea2d9c5b133e17629910","amp;dn":"CTV-W+5.S44E02.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc94bb4fbff359614edea2d9c5b133e17629910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,201,75,180,251,255,53,150,20,237,234,45,156,91,19,62,23,98,153,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
