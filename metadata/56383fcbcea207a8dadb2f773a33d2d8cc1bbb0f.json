It is interesting to hear Bill's insights on the economy, which with the benefit of hindsight seem like accurate predictions. Alex also discusses his recent (in 2004)heart attack.\n\n\nBill Pawalec died of cancer about one year following his shows, as did Alex's daughter Saucy. The Mysteries of the Mind radio show stopped bradcasting in 2005. The mp3 archives are listed on the web site but the archive is no longer available.\n\n\nwww.mysteriesofthemind.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56383fcbcea207a8dadb2f773a33d2d8cc1bbb0f","amp;dn":"Mysteries+of+the+Mind+-+Alex+Merklinger+and+Bill+Pawalec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56383fcbcea207a8dadb2f773a33d2d8cc1bbb0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,56,63,203,206,162,7,168,218,219,47,119,58,51,210,216,204,27,187,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
