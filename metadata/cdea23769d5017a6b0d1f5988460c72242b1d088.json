Lucifer, Beelzebub, The Beast, Satan... He has been called many names and taken many strange different forms over the ages. So where does the concept of the traditional evil come from?\n\nWhile early Christian clerics used the Devil as a symbol of heresy, the concept did not begin with the Christian Bible, but rather in ancient Persia some 3500 year ago. Since then, he has acquired horns, a forked tail and innumerable names in all aspects of world culture as well as a central role in the way we think. THE HISTORY OF THE DEVIL looks at how our concept of evil, as symbolized by the Devil, has evolved over the centuries to fit the needs of government, churches, demagogues and opportunists everywhere.\n\nWelsh film produced in association with SBS Australia and distributed by Siren Visual.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 399 MiB for 52mn 22s 42ms \n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 928 Kbps\nAspect            : 560 x 336 (1.667) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 124 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdea23769d5017a6b0d1f5988460c72242b1d088","amp;dn":"The+History+of+the+Devil+%282008%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdea23769d5017a6b0d1f5988460c72242b1d088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,234,35,118,157,80,23,166,176,209,245,152,132,96,199,34,66,177,208,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
