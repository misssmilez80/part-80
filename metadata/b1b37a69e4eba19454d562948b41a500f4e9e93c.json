Originally a small    |  \n|       operation, we have now reached levels of international acclaim.       |  \n|                                                                             |  \n|  SOUR is dedicated to both the availability and promotion of music to the   |  \n|  public, and our rips are intended to reflect these ideals. Specifically:   |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the promotion of new music that is currently         |  \n|   available to buy. If you like something you hear, you are obliged to      |  \n|   attempt to purchase an original copy.                                     |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the promotion of old music that may no longer be     |  \n|   available to buy.                                                         |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the expansion and infiltration of drum'n'bass        |  \n|   worldwide! We provide a service where none is available, specifically in  |  \n|   many remote countries where traditional distributors can not afford to    |  \n|   target. Also, the availability of drum'n'bass in an easily accessible     |  \n|   form expands the potential for real world sales to people who may not     |  \n|   otherwise have considered buying drum'n'bass.                             |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the expansion of the online and offline real world   |  \n|   scenes. With more listeners enjoying what they hear, clubs and venues can |  \n|   only expect MORE people to attend events; DJ's can only expect MORE       |  \n|   people to pay to see THEM.                                                |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| By accident of today's current real world distribution arrangements, many   |  \n|   artists will find that SOUR releases IMPROVE their real world sales;      |  \n|  especially for items only on vinyl. This is the basis upon which SOUR      |  \n|                                 operates.                                   |  \n|                                                                             |  \n`---------------------------------------------------------/                   |  \n                                                  ...... /____________________|  \n                                                  :            .                 \n                                               ...:..          :                 \n                                               :    :..........:                 \n                                               :....:                            \n                                             ::                                  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                 \n                      [ sour productions(c) 1999-2009 ]                          \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b37a69e4eba19454d562948b41a500f4e9e93c","amp;dn":"VA-Critical_Sound-CRITLP03-LP-2009-sour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b37a69e4eba19454d562948b41a500f4e9e93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,179,122,105,228,235,161,148,84,213,98,148,139,65,165,0,244,233,233,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
