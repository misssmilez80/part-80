Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo ~ 720x480\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio ~ 128 kbps\n\nSpoken ~ English\n\nSubs ~ None\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA DiabloDub rip means the highest standards on quality!
