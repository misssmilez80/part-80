From disease to addiction, parenting to attention deficit disorder, Dr. MatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s work focuses on the centrality of early childhood experiences to the development of the brain, and how those experiences can impact everything from behavioral patterns to physical and mental illness. While the relationship between emotional stress and disease, and mental and physical health more broadly, is often considered controversial within medical orthodoxy, Dr. MatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© argues too many doctors seem to have forgotten what was once a commonplace assumption, that emotions are deeply implicated in both the development of illness, addictions and disorders, and in their healing.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11315b1d21a3e278c3ead412d852d9f6f9d36e1","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+30+may+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11315b1d21a3e278c3ead412d852d9f6f9d36e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,19,21,177,210,26,62,39,140,62,173,65,45,133,45,159,111,157,54,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
