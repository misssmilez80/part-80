The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n                                                      Misterioso\n\n\n\nMisterioso is a 1958 (see 1958 in music) album by jazz musician Thelonious Monk. It was recorded live at the Five Spot Cafe with Thelonious Monk (piano), Johnny Griffin (sax), Ahmed Abdul-Malik (bass), and Roy Haynes (drums). The cover is taken from a painting by the Pittura Metafisica artist Giorgio De Chirico entitled The Seer (or The Prophet).\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Nutty&quot; (Thelonious Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5:21\n   2. &quot;Blues Five Spot&quot; (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“8:10\n   3. &quot;Let's Cool One&quot; (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“9:11\n   4. &quot;In Walked Bud&quot; (Barris-Clifford) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“11:15\n   5. &quot;Just A Gigolo&quot; (Monk-Best) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2:07\n   6. &quot;Misterioso&quot; (Monk-Best) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“10:44\n\nbonus tracks\n\n   1. &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; (Thelonious Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“6:16\n   2. &quot;Evidence&quot; (Thelonious Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“10:11\n\nbonus tracks were recorded at an earlier performance\n[edit] Personnel\n\n    * Thelonious Monk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ piano\n    * Johnny Griffin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tenor saxophone\n    * Ahmed Abdul-Malik ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass\n    * Roy Haynes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\n\n    * Orrin Keepnews - producer\n    * Ray Fowler - engineer\n    * Shigeo Miyamoto - mastering\n    * Paul Bacon - Cover Design\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ebf60f1abfbe244c60ff4a7082268f7a8078be2","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+Thelonious+Monk+-+Misterioso+-+FLAC+320+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ebf60f1abfbe244c60ff4a7082268f7a8078be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,191,96,241,171,251,226,68,198,15,244,167,8,34,104,247,168,7,139,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
