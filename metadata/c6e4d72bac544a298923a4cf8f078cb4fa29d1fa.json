Can anything disturb this beautiful night?             \n    Unfortunately Yes! There is something odd going on in the             \n    neighborhood... Alex is a good boy, but because of his hunger he's    \n    forced to be the egg thief. He's up to his foxy foray but he has      \n    one slight problem. It's the evening of the Full Moon and he's        \n    exposed to the weird stares of the curious villagers. As soon as      \n    they spot him, they're afoot and the mess begins. Pots, pans,         \n    pumpkins, scissors, everything they reach they throw on poor Alex..   \n    . Help Alex to avoid falling objects and catch enough eggs to feed    \n    himself. Go through as many levels as you can, while the situation    \n    complicates and quickens more and more. Then share your success       \n    with your friends on Facebook and Twitter through the OpenFeint       \n    integration.
