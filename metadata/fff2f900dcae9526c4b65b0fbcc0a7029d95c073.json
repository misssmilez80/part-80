Still combining largely electronic music with alternative hooks and lines, members Toni Halliday and Dean Garcia returned to a now-popular form of music they helped create years ago. Although the album's two best tracks had previously appeared on their late-1997 EP Chinese Burn (the title tracks from both the EP and the full-length), there are plenty of other strong tracks in attendance. &quot;Something Familiar&quot; may be the band's most melodically accessible track yet, while the extremely overdriven distortion and abrasive tones of &quot;Dogbone&quot; are just the opposite. Unlike many electronic bands, the duo makes it clear that they don't just go for musical overkill, as evidenced by the slow electronic groove contained in &quot;Killer Baby,&quot; and the mid-paced dance-rock of &quot;Cotton Candy.&quot; Come Clean is the welcome return of a band that deserved attention when it first appeared years ago, and may get it in the electro-friendly late '90s.\n\n\n01 Chinese Burn (4:50)\n02 Coming Up Roses (4:33)\n03 Something Familiar (4:07)\n04 Dog Bone (3:13)\n05 Alligators Getting Up (4:36)\n06 Dirty High (5:22)\n07 Killer Baby (3:54)\n08 Sweetback (4:31)\n09 Forgotten Sanity (4:33)\n10 Cotton Candy (5:32)\n11 Beyond Reach (4:55)\n12 Come Clean (2:16)\n13 Recovery (4:48)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fff2f900dcae9526c4b65b0fbcc0a7029d95c073","amp;dn":"Curve+-+Come+Clean+%281998%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fff2f900dcae9526c4b65b0fbcc0a7029d95c073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,242,249,0,220,174,149,38,196,182,91,15,188,192,167,2,157,149,192,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
