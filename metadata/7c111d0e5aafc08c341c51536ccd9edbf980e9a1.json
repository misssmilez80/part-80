TG Spirit brings the news and we chat for a few minutes before I talk to Raci from TransGeneration about being hearing impaired and life after the documentary.\n\nSRS-Online #2 Danielle Cornwell\n\nWe talk to Danielle Cornwell who has recently won a case of wrongful termination against her employer. She was fired just for transitioning, sued, and won. She got her job back, a cash settlement, and forced the employer to hire a transgender sensitivity trainer. You'll hear all about the experiance.\n\nSRS-Online #3 Gina Kamentsky\n\nIf you're looking for a creative mind in the community, look no further than Gina Kamentsky. She created, (among many, many other things) the comic known as T-Gina. Conversation with her is just interesting. Everything from talking about comparing notes as post-ops, to riding motorcycles, music, voting, and other stuff.\n\nSpeaking of voting, check out this TG Voting Guide for help with issues that TG people face at the ballot box. And if you are looking for some quick research on how to vote on a few things, check out this Score-card from the HRC.\n\nSRS-Online #4 Denise LeClair\n\nWe interview Denise LeClair who is the executive director of the International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE) about the organization and about the Transgender Tapestry magazine. \nOh by the way, we mention 5% of online sales from Walmart going to a GLBT group. A listner pointed out that this only applies if the purchase is made by a customer who entered through a link on this GLBT site.\n\nSRS-Online #5 Sandra Clark\n\nI interview Sandra Clark about her book, Running to Normal, and we talk about normalcy in general.  Teeg takes the week off so there's no news this week.  Don't worry, it all turned out OK\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c111d0e5aafc08c341c51536ccd9edbf980e9a1","amp;dn":"Susans+Radio+Show+Online+%28SRS-O%29+Shows+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c111d0e5aafc08c341c51536ccd9edbf980e9a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,17,29,14,90,175,192,140,52,28,81,83,108,205,158,219,249,128,233,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
