It tells the tale of a hero, FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez, who comes out of exile to become Count of Castile and overthrow the grip of Moorish tyranny with his mighty sword. GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡les was one of Spain's greatest heroes and a pioneer of guerilla warfare. Cult star Soledad Miranda has a small part as Maria, a Castilian woman who is to be given to the Moors to appease them. Interestingly enough, this drama was filmed at the actual sites in Spain where the events unfolded. The film might not be entirely accurate historically, but the actors are good and the movie overall is enjoyable to watch. \n\nFile: El Valle de las Espadas (1963) DVDRip XviD por Victoria.avi\nFilesize: 1391.50 Mb ( 1 459 095 552 bytes )\nPlay length: 02:06:08.279 (189207 frames)\nSubtitles: Not Present\nVideo: 688x456 (1.51:1), 25 fps, XviD MPEG-4 ~1340 kbps avg, 0.17 bit/pixel\nAudio: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~192.00 kbps avg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1446d69083cc52196f3c2d9bbdbe87fcb3bdfff","amp;dn":"El+valle+de+las+espadas+%2F+The+Castilian+%2F+Valley+of+the+Swords","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1446d69083cc52196f3c2d9bbdbe87fcb3bdfff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,68,109,105,8,60,197,33,150,243,194,217,187,219,232,127,203,59,223,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
