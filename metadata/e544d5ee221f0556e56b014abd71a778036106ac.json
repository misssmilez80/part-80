Defraggler gives you the power to select individual files and folders to defrag. So you can get the job done in seconds, rather than waiting for the whole drive to complete. Of course if you want to defrag the whole drive Defraggler will let you do that too.\n\n\nCompact and Portable\n\nDefraggler was written in the same compact architecture as other Piriform products (CCleaner and Recuva). This results in a compact single EXE application, which can be copied to a thumbdrive and then used whenever you need it, without a complex installation process. The EXE itself is less than 1MB!\n\n\nVista Support\n\nDefraggler supports all OSs released since Windows 2000, this includes Windows 2000, 2003, XP and Vista. 64-bit support has also just been added! Additionally Defraggler supports both NTFS and FAT32 file systems.\n\n\nLocate Files on the Drive\n\nAfter analysis Defraggler lists all the fragmented files on the drive. Selecting one or many will highlight their location on the disk. Allowing you to visually see the location of files on the disk.\n\n\nFreeware\n\nWhy pay hundreds of dollars for a commercial defragmentation tool, when you can use Defraggler for free! This includes corporate use as well!\n\n\nED2K Link:\ned2k://|file|dfsetup111.exe|874320|F36E4E173315DCB9502FD963E22F4768|h=VF26EUHIWSUUATIJXUMQS33ZB33B6KCD|/\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nAdded custom drive map colors (Options &gt; General &gt; Interface).\n\nFixed schedules for multiple drives.\n\nFragmented info is now displayed in df.exe.\n\n'Large files' can now be excluded from freespace defrag (Options &gt; Defrag &gt; Advanced).\n\nImprovements to the way crash data is collected.\n\nVarious minor UI tweaks.\n\nSeveral minor bugs fixed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e544d5ee221f0556e56b014abd71a778036106ac","amp;dn":"Defraggler+1.11.148","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e544d5ee221f0556e56b014abd71a778036106ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,68,213,238,34,31,5,86,229,107,1,74,189,113,167,120,3,97,6,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
