So, the band lasted a long time is what I'm saying.\n\nThey became famous in 1947 with their million-selling #1 hit &quot;Peg O' My Heart.&quot; Shortly thereafter, they were one of the only groups in America still recording records, as a musician's strike went into effect. Thankfully the harmonica was not actually a musical instrument (who knew?).\n\nIncluded from a long and prolific career are four albums:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Great Themes from TV &amp; Motion Pictures\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Christmas With The Don Les Harmonicats\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Try a Little Tenderness\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dolls Dolls Dolls\n\nPlus a good smattering of assorted songs, including:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A Taste Of Honey\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Galloping Comedians\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Harmonica Boogie\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Malaguena\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Minute Waltz\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Over the Rainbow\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sabre Dance\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tea For Two\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The Sardar March\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Yesterday","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587782468284ac6502f254fde091cadb00c40bf9","amp;dn":"Harmonicats+-+4+Albums%2C+Collected+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587782468284ac6502f254fde091cadb00c40bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,119,130,70,130,132,172,101,2,242,84,253,224,145,202,219,0,196,11,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
