The object was initially recovered in 1900, when a group of sponge divers stumbled upon an ancient shipwreck in the Mediterranean. According to Marchant, the wreck proved to be a treasure trove of Greek antiquity but the Antikythera mechanism, corroded and encrusted in sea growth, was overlooked. About a year later, in 1901, the rock-like crust cracked open and historians realized they had something special, she said.\n\nThe 2000-year-old device was extremely sophisticated, Marchant explained, noting that it was covered with highly-detailed inscriptions and composed of dozens of gear wheels that could be operated by a single dial on the side. Besides the Antikythera, Marchant pointed out that there are no other artifacts with gear wheels from the ancient world. In fact, there is no technology as sophisticated and compact as this mechanism until around the 17th century, she added.\n\nResearchers eventually concluded that the device was a 'calendar computer,' Marchant said, capable of accurately predicting the movement of the Sun, Moon, and the five planets known to ancient Greek astronomers. It also functioned as a 19-year calendar based on the lunar cycle, showed the location of the Greek games every four years, and had an eclipse indicator, Marchant noted. She suggested the Antikythera mechanism was likely built for a wealthy lay person and may have been used as a philosophical/religious demonstration of the workings of the heavens.\n\nWebsite(s):\ndecodingtheheavens.com\n\nBook(s):\nDecoding the Heavens\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2e763b058b52f9d4f8c411a8a98796a7070ed6","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+26+2009+-+Antikythera+Mechanism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2e763b058b52f9d4f8c411a8a98796a7070ed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,46,118,59,5,139,82,249,212,248,196,17,168,169,135,150,167,7,14,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
