The title character is a dustmop with a face--presumably a dog of some sort--whose craving for sweets inadvertently traps his beloved owner Florence in a frozen carousel and unleashes an evil wintry wizard named Zeebad (voiced by Jon Stewart, The Daily Show). Doogal and his ragtag group of friends--singing cow Ermintrude (Goldberg, Sister Act), hopeful snail Brian (William H. Macy, Fargo), slacker rabbit Dylan (Jimmy Fallon, Fever Pitch), and a choo-choo train (Chevy Chase, Fletch)--must find three enchanted diamonds to stop Zeebad and bring spring back to the world. Presumably, Doogal's target audience is the very young, yet the dialogue (rewritten for the American market) is crammed with allusions to adult fare like Saturday Night Live and Pulp Fiction. In fact--though it may have seemed differently with the original script--the entire movie comes across as an ungainly patchwork stitched together from scenes fromThe Wizard of Oz, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, Ice Age, and much more. The effect is not so much funny as inexplicable. Also featuring the voices of Judi Dench (Iris), Ian McKellen (X-Men), and pop star Kylie Minogue.\nGenre........: Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Family/Fantasy\nRuntime......: 01:18:32\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1086 kbps\nFramerate....: 25.000 fps\nAudio Codec..: Dolby AC3\n\nCategory:\tMovies &gt; DVDRip\nLanguage:\tEnglish  English\nTotal Size:\t699.44 MB\nInfo Hash:\teb7604856d4236217f2482a2ce2371b6592d0a5e\n[url]http://www.fhqhosting.com/ui/1ggggg.swf[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:641570a5b8da8551d6206e03db17db9666e470aa","amp;dn":"The.Magic.Roundabout%5BDoogal%5DDvDrip.AC3%5BEng%5D-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"641570a5b8da8551d6206e03db17db9666e470aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,21,112,165,184,218,133,81,214,32,110,3,219,23,219,150,102,228,112,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
