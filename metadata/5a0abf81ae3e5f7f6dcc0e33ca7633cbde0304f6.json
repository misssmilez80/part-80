Too shiny? Too flashy? Make it look the way you want by simply dragging images in to replace. Nice.\n\nApp + serial.\n\nLeopard only.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a0abf81ae3e5f7f6dcc0e33ca7633cbde0304f6","amp;dn":"CandyBar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a0abf81ae3e5f7f6dcc0e33ca7633cbde0304f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,10,191,129,174,62,95,127,109,204,14,51,202,118,51,203,222,3,4,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
