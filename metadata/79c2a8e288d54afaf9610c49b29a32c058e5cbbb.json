Mos Def (Street). Whereas in the original, Immortal Technique accused the Bush administration of orchestrating the 9/11 attack and using the subsequent War on Terror to spread an Anglo-American domination over the world, Brent Lee Regan turns his attention to Tony BlairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s administration in this remix and claims that the 7/7 attacks in London was also a False Flag carried out by covert operations in order to stay the course.\n\n\nARTIST INFO: Brent Lee Regan (born 17th of May 1979 in Swindon, UK) is an alternative hip hop artist from the UK whose lyrical delivery and content is as varied as his musical style. \n\nHonest and inquisitive; cynical yet hopeful, Brent Lee ReganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics often unapologetically address the power struggles and paradigm shifts in the shady world of politics, religion and the human condition.\n\nPLEASE SPREAD THIS TORRENT.
