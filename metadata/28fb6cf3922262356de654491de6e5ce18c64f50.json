Going deep inside the world of the HK police and triad societies, the lines  &gt; are often blurred between right and wrong. Featuring excellent performances from some of  &gt; Hong Kong's best actors; it is easy to see why Martin Scorsese has chosen to remake this  &gt; series with his upcoming film THE DEPARTED. This is crime cinema at its best.\n&gt;\n&gt; All stand-alone DivX Players are compatible\n&gt;\n&gt; Be Aware of fakes\n&gt;\n&gt; These are high-quality DVD rips from xpLicit\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28fb6cf3922262356de654491de6e5ce18c64f50","amp;dn":"Infernal+Affairs+Trilogy%5B2003%5DDvDrip%5BHK.EnGsubs%5D-xpL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28fb6cf3922262356de654491de6e5ce18c64f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,251,108,243,146,34,98,53,109,230,84,73,29,230,229,206,24,198,79,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
