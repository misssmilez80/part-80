However, his wife passes away at an early stage of their married life, and he must face hardships of raising three daughters alone. The main plot revolves around the mystery of his youngest daughter's disappearance, the crushing truths he faces when he finds out what really happened to her, and the impact on his other daughters as well as his mental stability. The film is unique because of the portrayal of the Pentecostal denomination quite extensively for first time on Malayalam cinema silver screen.[1] Critics described the film as Salim Kumar's &quot;graduation from a comedian to a mature character.&quot;\n\n\nscreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2319/achanurangaathaveedudvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e4b0e49a975260c021bb673756dcd0592dd5d3","amp;dn":"Achanurangatha+Veedu+%282006%29+-DVDRip+-ESubs+-Malayalam+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e4b0e49a975260c021bb673756dcd0592dd5d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,228,176,228,154,151,82,96,192,33,187,103,55,86,220,208,89,45,213,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
