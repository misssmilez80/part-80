Try and concentrate on the performance of DSB ;-)\n\nAlso enlosed DVD covers (from VHS artwork) which I've tidied up. If you print off as is (don't resize) they will print nicely.\n\nHTV Television 1985.\n\nAdded bonus of Shirley Bassey Sings Bond.\n\nYes, pretty poor show from this ill-thought out album. Vocals are OK but the music is truly awful.\n\nOnly uploading it as I like her version of Nobody Does it Better and so people can hear how NOT to arrange/play great Bond music even if the accompanying singer is great.\n\n2002\n\n01 - View to a Kill\n02 - Nobody Does it Better\n03 - From Russia With Love\n04 - We Have the Time in the World\n05 - You Only Live Twice\n06 - Diamonds Are Forever\n07 - Live and Let Die\n08 - Moonraker\n09 - For Your Eyes Only\n10 - All Time High\n11 - Thunderball\n12 - Goldfinger\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d6eb185df3599816b947ca7534919182b3a6a2","amp;dn":"Shirley+Bassey+-You+Ain%5C%27t+Heard+Nothing+Yet+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d6eb185df3599816b947ca7534919182b3a6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,214,235,24,93,243,89,152,22,185,71,202,117,52,145,145,130,179,166,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
