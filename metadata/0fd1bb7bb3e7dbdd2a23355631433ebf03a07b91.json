I was able to snag a copy before it was deleted, and after verifying how badass it is, I'm uploading it for you all following the site's guidelines.\n\nFeatures:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full install 2.2 GB, DVD not needed.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Half automated CD-swap-emulator via hot-key.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports XP / Vista / Win7 - 32/64.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports ALL types of TFT displays, including native wide screen.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ AA support.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Character Editor (also accessible via hot-key).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ HQ-PDF Manual.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ HQ-PDF Strategy Guide.\n\nIngame hot-keys\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT 1 = on the fly CD1 emulating.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT 2 = on the fly CD2 emulating.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT 3 = on the fly CD3 emulating.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT 4 = on the fly CD4 emulating.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT C = calls the Character Editor, FF8 minimizes.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT M = calls the HQ-PDF Manual, FF8 minimizes (will not work if Adobe Acrobat is already open).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CTRL ALT S = calls the HQ-PDF Strategy Guide (same as above).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ ALT F4 = Quick Exit (works MUCH better than the game's native Ctrl Q).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ NOTE: Alt Tab DOES NOT WORK.  Ctrl Alt Del will still minimize the game, however.\n\nOther Features\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Greater Stability\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pre-patched? - This I don't know for sure, as I haven't had much of a chance to play around with it, but I believe all the crashes and terrible glitches have already been patched; you should be able to just install and play like I did.  If not, there are plenty of torrents on this site with all the fixes.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New Config - The only time you really need to use the game's built in config is to set up your controls.  There is a new config accessed via ff8_launcher.exe that allows for higher screen resolutions that match most modern computers.  I was able to play this on my laptop at 1280 x 800, and it looked beautiful (better than the PSX version does on my TV) and ran without any troubles.\n\nInstallation\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mount with a virtual CD/DVD-drive emulator, or burn and put into your physical drive.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Install the game.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Install Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable (x32/x64) if needed (if it comes up asking you to &quot;Repair&quot; or &quot;Uninstall&quot;, you don't need to install.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Unmount or remove the DVD and play.\n\nSome other things to note\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ ALWAYS run the game from ff8_launcher.exe.  AWAYS.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ When playing on higher resolutions, FMVs glitch a little bit as they end (they shrink to a corner before disappearing and gameplay resumes).  This is just a minor cosmetic annoyance, and doesn't affect gameplay at all, but it was still something of note.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Game installs with a save in Slot 1, File 1 (for those that which to skip the opening sequence) and Slot 2, File 1 (to test the in game CD swapping).\n\nThe original torrent file spoke of some trouble with Nvidia GeForce cards.  I have a GeForce in both my laptop and my Vista desktop, and never ran into trouble.  If anyone does have trouble, I'll copy/paste this information into the description.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd1bb7bb3e7dbdd2a23355631433ebf03a07b91","amp;dn":"Final.Fantasy.VIII.Extended.DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd1bb7bb3e7dbdd2a23355631433ebf03a07b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,209,187,123,179,231,219,221,42,35,53,86,49,67,62,191,3,160,123,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
