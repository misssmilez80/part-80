When not busy working as a lab assistant, Persson would occasionally venture out to perform her songs on campus and at local clubs (she was somehow wrangled into playing a Love and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Awareness event, where tunes like &quot;You Are Not My Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Defrag My Heart&quot; doubtless had a certain resonance), and in 2005 began writing the songs that would become her first LP, Top Quality Bones and a Little Terrorist. With the help of Swedish rocker Kristofer AstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m, Persson went into a studio in 2006, and with Persson accompanied by Peter Hermansson (piano and accordion), Joanna Eriksson (violin), Mattias Friberg (bass), and Per Nordmark (percussion), the album was finished in a week. Released in the summer of 2006, Top Quality Bones and a Little Terrorist became a major critical success in Sweden and received similar buzz throughout Europe.       (Mark Deming, Rovi)\n\n2010 was a stressful year for Britta Persson. In September, she released her critically acclaimed album Current Affair Medium Rare, and her autumn diary was quickly filled with TV appearances, recordings and magazine interviews. But all this was just the result of a long period doing what she sees as her main occupation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ writing songs.\n\nTracklist:\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Annoyed To Death\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Meet A Bear\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Toast To M\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Some Girls Some Boys\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ For The Steadiness\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ If You DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Love Him\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Big Fuss\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Time Machine\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ He Flies A Jet\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Still Friends\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3da36121cbb1841d4cd0be7d5e8cf77b7809859","amp;dn":"Britta+Persson-Current+Affair+Medium+Rare+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3da36121cbb1841d4cd0be7d5e8cf77b7809859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,218,54,18,28,187,24,65,212,205,11,231,213,232,207,119,183,128,152,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
