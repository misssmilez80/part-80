He really was like the fifth member of the band. He was out in the studio with us, making suggestions and everything. He knew when we had a take. He would say, 'Play it as many times as you want, but that is the one right there.' He would go outside and have a cigarette and say, 'Let me know when you guys are through goofing around because this is the take we are using.' \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc07103b94af0c4f7a6bc665bd5d5988c476685","amp;dn":"Chickenfoot+-+Soap+On+A+Rope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc07103b94af0c4f7a6bc665bd5d5988c476685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,192,113,3,185,74,240,196,247,166,188,102,91,213,213,152,140,71,102,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
