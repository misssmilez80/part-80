This DVD contains clips of songs and interviews taken from Primus' 2003 tour. It also shows random clips between songs and interviews. The title of the DVD stems from an incident in the film where drummer Tim Alexander got food poisoning from bad fish at a restaurant, but still had to play a show that night and performed perfectly.\n\nDirected by Matthew J. Powers Produced by Powers Philms and Frizzle Fry Inc.\n\nThe band requested that the film be abstract, artistic, and that the songs not be shown in their entirety.\n\nTracklist\n\n   1. &quot;Mr. Krinkle&quot; (from Pork Soda)\n   2. &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; (from Sailing the Seas of Cheese)\n   3. &quot;Southbound Pachyderm&quot; (from Tales from the Punchbowl)\n   4. &quot;De Anza Jig&quot; (from Tales from the Punchbowl)\n   5. &quot;Over The Electric Grapevine&quot; (from Tales from the Punchbowl)\n   6. &quot;Hello Skinny&quot; (The Residents cover, from Duck Stab/Buster &amp; Glen)\n   7. &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (from Pork Soda)\n   8. &quot;Bob&quot; (from Pork Soda)\n   9. &quot;Mary the Ice Cube&quot; (from Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People)\n  10. &quot;Pilcher's Squad&quot; (from Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People)\n  11. &quot;American Life&quot; (from Sailing the Seas of Cheese)\n  12. &quot;Mr. Knowitall&quot; (from Frizzle Fry)\n\nRegion-free ISO can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5014692&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5014692&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a612fb98f6c5f47aba5e27b0b6786c508f7463fc","amp;dn":"Primus+-+Blame+It+On+The+Fish+%5BAVI%5D+%7EThe_Spiral","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a612fb98f6c5f47aba5e27b0b6786c508f7463fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,18,251,152,246,197,244,122,186,94,39,176,182,120,108,80,143,116,99,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
