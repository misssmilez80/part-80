As an assassin, Jack is constantly on the move and always alone. After a job in Sweden ends more harshly than expected for this American abroad, Jack retreats to the Italian countryside. He relishes being away from death for a spell as he holes up in a small medieval town. While there, Jack takes an assignment to construct a weapon for a mysterious contact, Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). Savoring the peaceful quietude he finds in the mountains of Abruzzo, Jack accepts the friendship of local priest Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli) and pursues a torrid liaison with a beautiful woman, Clara (Violante Placido). Jack and Clara's time together evolves into a romance, one seemingly free of danger. But by stepping out of the shadows, Jack may be tempting fate.\n\n\nR, 1 hr. 45 min.\n\nMystery &amp; Suspense, Drama\n\nDirected By:Anton Corbijn\n\nWritten By:Rowan Joffe\n\n\nIn Theaters: Sep 1, 2010 Wide\n\nOn DVD: Dec 28, 2010\n\nUS Box Office:$35.6M\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f4105cf6dea45982f4aa366a15336fc4c27dee2","amp;dn":"The+American+2010+With+Greek+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f4105cf6dea45982f4aa366a15336fc4c27dee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,65,5,207,109,234,69,152,47,74,163,102,161,83,54,252,76,39,222,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
