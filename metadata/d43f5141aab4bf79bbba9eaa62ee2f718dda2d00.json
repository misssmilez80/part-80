Numerous acts from around the world, newcomers as well as established artists, use &quot;sounds from the plug&quot; again and again and reach the hearts of their listeners with this reputedly cold style. Some bands even succeed in becoming more than just a big name within the electronic scene. The Hamburg-based label Major Records has been concentrating on innovative electro pop from the start, and has already presented an astonishing spectrum of this musical style with the three volumes of the successful &quot;Elektrisch!&quot; compilation series. Now, they begin a new era of samplers with the title &quot;Orbit Electro&quot;.  The first volume is a double album with an exciting mixture of popular bands and new discoveries. With this new compilation, Major Records prove again their grasp for interesting electronic pop music, regardless of any clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s of the genre. Rare tracks and remixes come from established contributors such as MESH, LADYTRON, IAMX, ONETWO, CELLULOIDE,MECHANICAL CABARET and BOYTRONIC,. New in the electronic orbit are promising acts such as DRAGONS, AEROPHONICS, ANTILLES and THE ATTERY SQUASH. &quot;Orbit Electro&quot; will surely surprise its listeners with this unique lineup.&quot; \n\ncd1 \n\n01 DRAGONS - Treasure (Danny Saber Mix) 05:28 \n02 IAMX - Nightlife 06:57 \n(People Theatre's Trip to Berlin Mix) \n03 THE ATTERY SQUASH - Devo Was Right About Everything 03:07 \n(Devo Remix) \n04 LADYTRON - Destroy Everything You Touch 07:55 \n(Hot Chip Remix) \n05 EDEN - Subhuman 03:48 \n06 MESH - So Important 03:42 \n07 ONETWO - Cloud Nine 04:44 \n08 ANTILLES - You And Me 04:23 \n09 AEROPHONICS - My Space 04:09 \n10 SCARLET SOHO - Modern Radio 03:07 \n11 BOYTRONIC - Blue Velvet (Razormaid Mix) 05:32 \n12 MECHANICAL CABARET - Let's Go To Bed 03:41 \n13 ELECTRO SPECTRE - Six Strings From Hell 03:32 \n14 NONO - Well Said 04:02 \n\ncd2 \n\n01 THE STRAND - You Make Me Crazy 02:48 \n02 TENEK - No More Time For Fighting 04:10 \n03 POLAROID KISS - Stop Motion 03:42 \n04 ULTIMA BLEEP - X The I's And Dot The T's 05:33 \n(Haunebu Mix by Funker Vogt) \n05 EMPIRE STATE HUMAN - Seeing Stars 04:21 \n06 FORETASTE - Anachronic 04:24 \n07 CELLULOIDE - Audio Therapy 04:36 \n08 LOIC RATHSCHECK - Robots In Love 03:25 \n09 NORTHERN KIND - Into The Blue 04:10 \n10 MOTUS feat.SYNTHETIK FORM - Truth 05:45 \n11 MINK - I Don't Care 03:16 \n12 JANOSCH MOLDAU - Clear (PT's Bright Mix) 06:44 \n13 LAVANTGARDE - Take Me s.i.m. 04:24 \n14 P 24 - Zu weit weg 04:26 \n15 DIE LOGE - In der Stille der Nacht 03:51 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43f5141aab4bf79bbba9eaa62ee2f718dda2d00","amp;dn":"Orbit+Electro+Vol.+1+%28VA%29+EAC%3EFLAC+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43f5141aab4bf79bbba9eaa62ee2f718dda2d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,63,81,65,170,180,191,121,187,186,158,170,98,238,47,113,141,218,45,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
