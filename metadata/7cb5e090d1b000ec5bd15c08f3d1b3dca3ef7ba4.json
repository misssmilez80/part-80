Thanks to Nate Lavey for the heads-up. Notable are the foregrounding of the sonic elements that were always present in MarkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s films, yet often took a more subliminal position in deference to the commentary, which here is explicitly abstained from, as the add-on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œframingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the film provided by arte points out.\n\nThis style of sound painting recalls Holgar Czukay and David SylvianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Plight and Premonition and BiosphereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Substrata ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ambient atmospherics integrating radio wave sampling that MarkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s otherworldly sonic backdrops predate by a long shot (watch La JetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e someday with your eyes closed :&gt;).\nJunkopia Owl\n\nCommuters from the East Bay to San Francisco will be familiar with this no manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s landscape in Emeryville culled from the floatable spare parts of the city, washed ashore. The animal forms, such as the watchful tinfoil owl above, receive their due attention, as is so often the case in MarkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s productions, whatever the scale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb5e090d1b000ec5bd15c08f3d1b3dca3ef7ba4","amp;dn":"Junkopia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb5e090d1b000ec5bd15c08f3d1b3dca3ef7ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,181,224,144,209,176,0,236,91,209,92,8,243,209,179,220,163,239,123,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
