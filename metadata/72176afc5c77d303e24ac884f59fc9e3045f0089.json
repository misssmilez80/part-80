First there are the obvious and interesting orthographic links to the original &quot;Generations&quot; title. More important, one of the goals of Star Trek VII was to regenerate the movie franchise. Similarly, my version is an attempt to regenerate the film and the story itself. I've done so by introducing significant changes to the movie's beginning and controversial ending. Scattered throughout the movie's middle action are more minor changes consisting mostly of cuts and trims. Collectively these changes result in a running time of 1 hour 40 minutesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½about 18 minutes shorter than the original Generations.\n\nA GRAND OPENING\n   Star Trek: Regeneration begins in very different fashion by bridging back to what is arguably one of the best films in the entire franchise: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. There has always been an implied narrative bridge connecting VI with VII; I've just made that bridge more literal on the screen. To be sure, this change injects new emotional and dramatic effect into the movie, but admittedly the effect might play out differently if one were to watch The Undiscovered Country and Regeneration on the same day. Regeneration essentially transforms the sense of closure from Star Trek VI to a sense of continuation.\n   The cold open is also part of a new opening titles sequence. We now hear the closing music from VI during the main title and cast credits. The original McCarthy score kicks in when the champagne bottle crashes and is used for the production credits. The other notable change is that the production credits continue into the opening scene. This was necessary because of the changes to the length and timing of the music and footage.\n\nKIRK's DEATH\n   Much of the criticism directed at Generations tends to be concerned with the movie's ending, in which Captain James T. Kirk finally meets his own end. Some fans simply don't like the idea that Kirk dies in Star Trek VII. Others have no problem accepting Kirk's death into Trek canon; they just despise how the death was written and portrayed on the big screen. Still other fans contend that Kirk's death is never certain.\n   The narrative strategy in Regeneration is to create an ending that is tasteful and provides more fuel for the imagination, so that there is sufficient reason for believing either (a) Kirk is dead, or (b) Kirk isn't necessarily dead. I don't want the movie to answer this question. Instead, I hope Regeneration can allow each of us to enjoy our own ending with the dignity it deserves.\n\nTIMELINE BRIDGE\n   The third significant change in Regeneration concerns the timeline bridge, where the story advances 78 years. I have removed the entire holodeck &quot;sailing&quot; sequence and all the continuation shots that show senior officers in ridiculous cosplay. The new timeline bridge is more sci-fi in my opinion because it transitions from a space-exterior shot of Enterprise-B to a space-exterior shot of Enterprise-D approaching the Amargosa observatory. Data pushing Crusher into the water is now presented as a flashback to restore plot continuity.\n\nSAUCER CRASH LANDING\n   The best way to appreciate what has changed here is to watch from Regeneration and then watch from the original Generations. You will see quickly that many of the original effects are just too slow. Regeneration presents a much more thrilling and realistic crash sequence.\n\nKIRK's NEXUS\n   The scene where Captains Picard and Kirk meet for the first time in Kirk's Nexus represents an extraordinary event that deserves serious treatment. Unfortunately, Generations peppered the scene with moments that violate good sense. Chief among these is Kirk's complete disregard for the moment and Picard when he interrupts the story with a request for oregano. I also never liked Antonia's off-camera pestering, which I think does nothing but intrude and disrupt the emotional momentum of the moment. Thus, the Kirk's Home scene has been heavily re-worked to be more serious and more believable.\n   Regeneration also cuts the Idaho Barn scene completely. Passage out of Kirk's Nexus (or perhaps into a different Nexus) is triggered sooner, when Kirk slams the bedroom door. This creates a new story twist because we see Kirk on Veridian III before we learn that he changed his mind.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS EDITS\n\n    * Removed Picard's second &quot;It's alright&quot; during his chat with Troi. In the original Generations, Patrick Stewart creates an awkward moment when his eyes fall too close to the camera.\n    * Trimmed the heated exchange in stellar cartography so that Picard puts his foot down sooner. It now plays out like Picard uses Data's emotion to get him back in line, thus making Picard appear more in-control and clever.\n    * Respliced the plasma coil sequence to eliminate the silly slow-motion mayhem shot.\n    * Repainted the transporter beam on Verdian III because the script makes it clear that Picard beamed from the Klingon ship.\n    * Trimmed Data's &quot;life-forms&quot; bit. The essence of the moment is still intact, but without being so annoying and silly.\n    * Trimmed shot of Picard pinned under the displaced rocks. The full shot shows clearly that he is not pinned at all!\n    * Trimmed Picard's Nexus so that the entry point is now him staring at the Christmas tree. Picard's Nexus in Generations is just too long, and I really hate the opening shot on the merry-go-round.\n    * Kirk's body is no longer visible under the wreckage, but now we can make out his badge resting on a nearby rock. The badge gives off a glowing/reflective effect similar to Picard's Christmas tree. Note that these changes don't imply that Kirk's body is somewhere else; it just means that the shot cannot be used to visually confirm or deny what happened after the explosion.\n    * The sense of torch passing that opens the movie is actually brought to light during the finale, when we hear Kirk's final words of advice for Captain Picard.\n    * The end credits are slightly longer than the original, so the music has been expanded with new soundtrack elements.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://digital-fanedits.com/index.php/Details/Star-Trek/Star-Trek-Regeneration.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://digital-fanedits.com/index.php/Details/Star-Trek/Star-Trek-Regeneration.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72176afc5c77d303e24ac884f59fc9e3045f0089","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Regeneration+%28Premiere+Release%29+-+deLimited+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72176afc5c77d303e24ac884f59fc9e3045f0089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,23,106,252,92,119,211,3,226,74,200,132,245,159,201,227,4,95,0,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
