Later, as part of the variety double act Jewel and Warriss, he became a popular music hall star. Jewel continued a successful career on radio, stage and screen before cementing his position as one of the great survivors and adapters when he made the transformation to accomplished straight actor.\n\n Jimmy Jewel's story reflects the changing face of British light entertainment over 60 years, and this programme is peppered with classic Jewel archive and includes contributions from actor Jean Boht and variety entertainer John Styles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Audio Format    : MP3\n Duration Approx : 28mn 54s\n Bit rate mode   : Constant\n Bit rate        : 128 Kbps\n Channel(s)      : 2 channels\n Sampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n Resolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33144197624f594c09599b110f4a8f4cf43f079b","amp;dn":"A+%28Jimmy%29+Jewel+In+The+Comedy+Crown+-+Audio+Documentary+-+MP3+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33144197624f594c09599b110f4a8f4cf43f079b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,20,65,151,98,79,89,76,9,89,155,17,15,74,143,76,244,63,7,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
