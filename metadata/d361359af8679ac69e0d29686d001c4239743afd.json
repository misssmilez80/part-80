You play as five different &quot;CreaVures,&quot; tiny mythical creatures that each have a unique natural ability, to be used alone or in tandem to solve platforming puzzles. Ultimately your CreaVures must travel deep into the dying forest to gather essence and restore the light.\n\n&quot;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Few puzzle/platformers manage to achieve the balance which is clearly displayed by CreaVures. A few simple elements come into play and combine to create a deep, enjoyable experience.&quot;\n-MMGN\n\n&quot;The game kept me glued, and I am planning on 100-ing this (that is rare for me).&quot;\n-Marooners Rock\n\n&quot;I'm just very very in to this.&quot;\n-PC Gamer podcast\n\n&quot;Damn beautifulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the game looks really good, with a dreamy, color-tinged forest at night, and the CreaVures themselves have interesting concepts and smooth animation.&quot;\n-AV Club\n\n&quot;Few platform puzzlers have ever been as unfairly pretty as CreaVures.&quot;\n-EuroGamer\n\n&quot;Creavures is relaxing and mellow which is a nice contrast from gritty high octane games that saturate the gaming market.&quot;\n-CrossPlatformGamers\n\n&quot;It takes a special kind of game to seamlessly balance a beautiful art style with compelling gameplay.&quot;\n-pnosker\n\n&quot;Creavures is a gorgeous title, chock-full of creative character designs, glowing graphics, and moody, ambient tunes.&quot;\n-BitMob\n\n&quot;It's worth every penny.&quot;\n-Beantown Gamer\n\n\nManual\n1.
