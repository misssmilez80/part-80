The film score was written by William Walton, the Spitfire Prelude\nand Fugue.\n\nIt is a biography of R.J. Mitchell, the designer of the Supermarine Spitfire.\nThe film's title refers to the words of Winston Churchill who, when\nspeaking of the Battle of Britain aircrew said: &quot;Never in the field of human\nconflict was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot;\n\nAlmost inevitably, because the film was made during the Second World\nWar and dealt with subjects related to the war, it was effectively\npropaganda and consequently contained several inaccuracies:\n\n* In the film Mitchell's exact illness is not mentioned. Mitchell had rectal\ncancer and had a colostomy in 1933. However the film gave many people\nthe impression that he had tuberculosis.\n\n* Mitchell did not work himself to death on the Spitfire, an impression\none could conceivably get from this film. He did make sacrifices for his\nwork despite the pain of his illness, and he did continue tweaking and\nperfecting the Spitfire design up until his death, so this is more misleading\nthan inaccurate.\n\n* Mitchell did not visit Germany and so never met Willy Messerschmitt.\nThe film shows that the trip convinced him to design the Spitfire.\n\nThe First of the Few was a British film produced and directed by Leslie\nHoward, with Howard in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell. It tells the story\nof Mitchell's life and how he developed the design for the famous RAF\nfighter. David Niven plays his friend and test pilot Geoffrey Crisp, who\nnarrates the biography in flashback. Leslie Howard bore little\nresemblance to R. J. Mitchell, however, as Mitchell was a large and\nathletic man. Howard portrayed Mitchell as upper class and mildmannered.\nMitchell - &quot;the Guv'nor&quot; - was in fact working class and had an\nexplosive temper; apprentices were told to watch the colour of his neck\nand to run if it turned red.\n\nHowever, the film contains precious footage that would be otherwise be\nlost to posterity:\n\n* Film footage of the Supermarine S.4 in taking off from Southampton\nWater, and in flight, which is now available nowhere else.\n\n* Inter-war footage of aerobatic German sailplane flight, of a Grunau\nBaby in flight, and a Lohning Lo. 100 pulling loop. Again, this is rare\nfootage and thus precious.\n\nLeslie Howard's portrayal of Mitchell has a special significance since\nHoward was killed when the transport aircraft in which he was a\npassenger was shot down by the Luftwaffe one year after the film was\nreleased.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/c955d542061214&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/c955d542061214&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 699 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 859 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d29abbb5ba929ee6fce3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate                         : 650 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 664 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nLanguage                         : English\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156b0a4247bb5d14b8941af1d55cef065cbe357c","amp;dn":"The+First+of+the+Few+1942+%5Bx264-ac3-mkv%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156b0a4247bb5d14b8941af1d55cef065cbe357c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,107,10,66,71,187,93,20,184,148,26,241,213,92,239,6,92,190,53,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
