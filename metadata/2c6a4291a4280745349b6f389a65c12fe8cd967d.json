Throughout the movie, Will writes journal-like e-mails to Bowie seeking approval of his music, although Bowie never answers. When Will's mother finds a new job, he switches to a new school, which he is eager to do since he was bullied at his previous one. During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl whose name is written Sa5m, but pronounced Sam (Vanessa Hudgens). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends, but shortly after, he is sought after by another girl named Charlotte Barnes (Alyson Michalka). One afternoon, Charlotte asks Will to join her in an after-school day-care center. When she starts inviting him to hang out with her, the teenager is stunnedÃ¢â‚¬â€as is his single mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow). Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/ska band. Her goal is apparently to take revenge on her egocentric musician ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatley (Scott Porter) during Bandslam.\n\nUnsure of what he is getting himself into, Will agrees to help Charlotte's band (later called &quot;I Can't Go On, I'll Go On&quot;) which includes Bug (Charlie Saxton) and Omar (Tim Jo), eventually expanding it with more like-minded outcasts. These include drummer Basher Martin, who first hesitates, but decides to join after Will tells he has an older sister who is often around (in fact this is Karen). Against all odds, the group's sound starts to come together and their prospects for success look bright. Even more surprising, Will starts losing his &quot;loser-status&quot;. Once he gets committed in Charlotte's band, however, he is unable to complete a project he was going to do with Sa5m. After that, Sa5m starts ignoring Will at school. He visits her house one night, hoping to apologize. Her mom then shows him a video of a younger Sa5m performing &quot;Everything I Own&quot;, but when Sa5m walks in, she is outraged and orders Will to leave. As an apology, he makes a short yet touching documentary about her for his Human Studies project and she eventually forgives him.\n\nBut in order to ruin Will's image, Ben decides to do a little research on him. He finds out about Will's father, who was sent to prison years ago when he accidentally killed a child while driving drunk. Ben then starts to call Will &quot;Dewey&quot; (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for &quot;DWI,&quot; Driving While Intoxicated. Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, whom he is ashamed of. What is more, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. As she explains to Will, her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick, she decided to change her image and be nicer to &quot;people like [Will]&quot;, meaning outcasts, hoping that this good behavior would cause her dad to get well. The band members are hurt by this discovery, as it means she did not genuinely like them, but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976222/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976222/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c6a4291a4280745349b6f389a65c12fe8cd967d","amp;dn":"BANDSLAM.2009.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c6a4291a4280745349b6f389a65c12fe8cd967d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,106,66,145,164,40,7,69,52,155,111,56,154,101,193,47,232,205,150,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
