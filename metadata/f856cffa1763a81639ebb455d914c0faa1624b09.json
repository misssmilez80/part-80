Predominantly the comedy is played out between Hi Jiayu and the two brothers, Dezhi and Debao. Comedy is culturally relevant, so sometimes yes, what was meant to be funny, though well executed, did not affect this reviewer as it would a Chinese audience. I knew it was supposed to be funny, I just did not find it funny. And that is just cultural. I did find the Weekend at BernieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bit right at the end of the film a wee bit disturbing mind you. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll know it when you see it. Its right at the very end of the film before the ending credit pops up. You know how those Shaw Brothers films ended. The villain is defeated and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s it. There is nothing else to say. End the damn movie already! THE END! Good, now get out of the theatre!\n\nWhat is amazing about this film is that for the life of me I could not find nearly as much information as I hoped about this film from my mainstream film sources. It is as if the film did not exist. This is a sad fact because how else would the common man know this gem of a martial arts film even existed? Kid From Kwangtung should be part of your collection. It is an action film, starring action actors, directed by an action choreographer. I do wish that Lee Pak LingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s script didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t focus so long on the comedy but beggars cannot be choosers. It is a good action film.\n\n\nPlease seed this 4 others 4 as long as possible, pass on the enjoyment. comments welcome \n\n\nAs usual fully retail 4 the purists menu's as i insist on \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f856cffa1763a81639ebb455d914c0faa1624b09","amp;dn":"Kid+From+Kwangtung+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f856cffa1763a81639ebb455d914c0faa1624b09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,86,207,250,23,99,168,22,57,235,180,85,217,20,192,250,161,98,75,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
