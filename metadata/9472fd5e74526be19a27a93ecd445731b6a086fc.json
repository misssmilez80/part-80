It \n\nwas made with a program called BDtoAVCHD.  It was compressed with X264 in a 2 pass encode on  a Quad \n\ncore processor and 4GB of memory. The process is completely automatic , you just pick the size you \n\nwant the final file to be. I then used IMG burn to burn to DVD and tested it on a Samsung C6500 BR \n\nplayer. It reacted the same as HD-R-US discs and started playing after insertion. There is no menu. \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n******************************************************************************************************\n\n******************************************************************************************************\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n*******************                                                                        Here is the info for burning from an old HD-R-US post.*****************************\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tI M P O R T A N T   I N F O R M A T I O N\n\nBy using ImgBurn and selecting &quot;Write image file to disc&quot;, this iso can be burnt straight to a DVD5 \n\ndisc to be played back on any stand-alone, AVCHD compatible, Blu-ray or DVD-HD player, including PS3. \n\nPlease note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT \n\nplay this movie without re-encoding it.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to stream the movie or watch it on your computer, Daemon Tools virtual \n\ndrive can be used to mount the image file, or PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to \n\nextract the files and folders from the iso. This is a blu-ray/AVCHD iso, not a DVD iso, so \n\napplications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise it. The movie file itself will be located in \n\nthe BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named &quot;00000.m2ts&quot;. Once extracted, if you decide to save the \n\nmovie by burning it onto a DVD5 disc, your ImgBurn settings need to be as follows:-\n\nClick &quot;Write files/folders to disc&quot;\nAdd both the BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders\nSelect the Options Tab-\nData Type = MODE1/2048\nFile System = UDF\nUDF Revision = 2.50\nMake sure that the &quot;Recurse Subdirectories&quot; field IS checked, and all other fields are NOT checked.\nInsert your DVD5 disc and click Burn.\n\nThe relevant codecs need to be installed to watch any HD movie on your computer. K-Lite's codec pack \n\nis free to download, but there are numerous others                                                ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9472fd5e74526be19a27a93ecd445731b6a086fc","amp;dn":"The_Tourist_REPACK_2010_AVCHD_TTL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9472fd5e74526be19a27a93ecd445731b6a086fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,114,253,94,116,82,107,225,154,39,169,62,205,68,87,49,182,160,134,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
