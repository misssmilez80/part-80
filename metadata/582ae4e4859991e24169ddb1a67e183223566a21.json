If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:582ae4e4859991e24169ddb1a67e183223566a21","amp;dn":"Lazesoft+Recover+My+Password+1.0+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"582ae4e4859991e24169ddb1a67e183223566a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,42,228,228,133,153,145,226,65,105,221,177,166,126,24,50,35,86,106,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
