Their music\n   combines Roots, Rock and Pop, giving them the range to play stripped down\n   acoustic porch music or to turn it up and rock with the best of them. All the\n   members are veterans of the music business and have shared the stage with\n   several successful bands over the years including Frog Legs, The Circuit\n   Riders, Glitter Boot, Hubcap Fetish, Tobacco Row Exchange. As each of the\n   band members were searching for the next step in their musical journey, the\n   band came together to create their own brand of Americana Rock. The Lost\n   Souls is fronted by Gray Gurkin, a talented songwriter who has played in both\n   Austin &amp; Nashville. He has been praised for his songwriting and his\n   outstanding live performances. The rhythm section brings the songs to new\n   levels with Chip Farnsworth on the skins and Turtle Zwadlo on the bass, both\n   of whom have made their mark on the East coast band circuit. The Americana\n   flavor shines though with Chris Berndt on fiddle adding some sawdust gloss.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
