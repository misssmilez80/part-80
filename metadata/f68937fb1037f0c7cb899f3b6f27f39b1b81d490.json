Keeps your files close, and your time closer.\n\nWhy You Need a Launcher\nThe Dock in Mac OS X is a handy place to put the applications and documents you use constantly every day; Just one click and you're ready to go. But what if you have a lot of them, too many for the Dock? What about the apps and documents you don't use quite as frequently, but still want nearby? Navigating through Finder can take far too many clicks. Spotlight can be as helpful as a snail delivering rush order packages. So what do you do?\n\nWhy You Need QuickPick\nQuickPick keeps any number of applications just a mouse flick (or keyboard shortcut) away. When you activate QuickPick, all of the windows on your system will zoom off into the distance, and the documents and apps you want close by will fly right into view. It's like having a fourth dimension just for your files.\n\nQuickPick displays files, folders, and application as clickable icons which can be arranged in any way you want by simply dragging them around, similar to the Desktop in Finder. If you need even more space, just add more pages. To launch an application or open a document from inside of QuickPick, just click on it. You can also select and launch items with the keyboard.\n\nHomepage\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.araelium.com/quickpick/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.araelium.com/quickpick/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f68937fb1037f0c7cb899f3b6f27f39b1b81d490","amp;dn":"Araelium+Group+QuickPick+v2.0.5+MacOSX+Cracked-NOY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f68937fb1037f0c7cb899f3b6f27f39b1b81d490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,137,55,251,16,55,240,199,203,137,159,59,111,39,243,155,27,129,212,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
