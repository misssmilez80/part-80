Secret Weapons of\nWWII expansion pack is NOT required to play Battle of Britain in this mode.\n\nInvasion of the Philippines has been slightly revised.

This details what the\n    main icons represent in the Server Browser Interface.\n  - Server Information pane will now detail which mods are present in the server rotation\n\nOther Fixes / changes :\n\n - The game.listPlayers command shows the cd key hash of the local player\n - Slightly improved loading speed of maps\n - Fixed sinking destroyer bug\n - Changed APC exit point to minimize certain exploits \n - Fixed an exploit involving damage to Aircraft Carriers \n - Fixed crash bug when a dead bot was thrown through a window or door.\n\nDEDICATED SERVER SPECIFIC CHANGES / BUG FIXES\n\nAdded support for Punkbuster anti-cheat software.\n  - Visit http://www.evenbalance.com for more information\n\nWin32 dedicated server implemented through back-port of the Linux dedicated\nserver.\n\n  - Runs in console mode displaying a status monitor with an\n    interactive console.\n  - The server uses a different binary than the game (bf1942_w32ded.exe).\n  - Status monitor changes (compared to Linux server 1.5):\n    - Added chat feedback.\n    - Added number of tickets and current round number.\n    - Added game state (playing, paused, etc.).\n\nAdded support for mixing mods, maps and game modes in the maplist.\n\n  - As a result of this the game.serverGamePlayMode command in the\n    ServerSettings.con file and the +game command line argument are now\n    obsolete for dedicated servers and should not be used.\n\n  - The Maplist.con was changed to allow three arguments:\n    game.addLevel &lt;mapname&gt; &lt;game mode&gt; &lt;mod&gt;, i.e.:\n    game.addLevel Gazala GPM_CQ bf1942\n    ** NOTE : the following commands now also use this functionality:\n            - admin.changeMap\n            - admin.setNextLevel\n\n  - Updated the DedicatedServer.exe launcher program to allow for\n    creation of maplists with the new functionality.\n\n  - Please note that all old maplists are incompatible with this new\n    feature and will have to be created again. Running the server with\n    an old map list will not work.\n\nAdded installation sanity checking that will tell you about common installation\nerrors such as missing files. The sanity checking is done automatically at\nstartup.\n\nAdded more readable error messages for common errors such as misspelled level\nnames.\n\nUpdated chat system:\n\n  - Fixed &quot;chat lag&quot; by streaming messages over a high-priority channel.\n  - Added basic flood protection which prevents players from taking to much\n    chat bandwidth by &quot;spamming&quot;.\n  - Added chat text as messages to the status monitor console.\n\nGameSpy/ASE host reporting changes:\n\n  - Added (kills/deaths) to ASE score format.\n  - Added roundTimeLeft to GameSpy keys.\n  - Added reporting of cd key hashes to GameSpy keys.\n  - Added active_mods key showing all mods in map cycle.\n  - Added content_check key showing content checking mode.\n  - Converted GameSpy reporting keys to lowercase and replaced spaces with\n    underscores to facilitate filtering in external browsers.\n\nUpgraded XML logging format to 1.1:\n\n  - Added support for CD key hashes for players.\n  - Fixed a few spelling errors for keys.\n  - Fixed a bug where compressed XML logs where sometimes being corrupted.\n  - Escapes non-printable characters as bf:nonprint tags.\n  - Added chat text messages to the XML stream.\n\nUpdated banning system:\n\n  - Bans can be set on CD key hashes as well as IP addresses.\n\n  - Timeouts can be specified in these ways:\n    admin.banPlayerKey &lt;player_id&gt; [timeout]\n\n    Where timeout can take one of these formats:\n        - Omitted or 'perm' meaning that the ban is permanent\n        - An integral number meaning the number of seconds the ban will be active\n          (i.e. 3600 means one hour)\n        - 'round', meaning the ban is active until the next map\n        - An integral number prepended by a colon (i.e. :1234567), meaning the\n          epoch exporation time of the ban (number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970).\n      This option is most usable by external tools.\n\n  - IP address bans continue to work as earlier but include\n    the new timeout options as well.\n\n  - Bans are stored as absolute times in banlist.con. Existing bans in\n    banlist.con will be interpreted as permanent bans.\n\nThe game.listPlayers command lists cd key hashes of connected players when\nrunning in internet mode.\n\nThe game.showPorts console command can be invoked to display the ports\ncurrently used by the server.\n\nUpdated content crc generation:\n\n  - Generation bat files are now created only for the mods you select. The new\n    bat files are named getcrc-&lt;modname&gt;.bat.\n \nUpdated remote console output:\n\n  - The remote console now mirrors text written to the main console by prepending\n    each mirrored line by a hash character (#). This is useful to capture chat\n    text from external tools that periodically send commands to the remote\n    console.\n  - Please note that if several remote connections are made, the state of the\n    mirroring is cleared so that mirrored console lines can easily be lost.\n    Thus if you plan to use this feature in a tool, please only connect with one\n    remote console connection at a time to ensure that you will get the correct\n    results.\n\nAdded overlayPath feature to support running multiple server instances from the\nsame installation directory. To set up an instance, please follow these steps:\n  - Create a new, empty directory to hold the instance, for instance C:\\Server1\n  - Copy the mods\\bf1942\\Settings directory from the main installation to the\n    new directory\n  - Create a new, empty Logs directory in the instance directory\n  - Start the server with the overlayPath argument in a shortcut:\n    bf1942_w32ded.exe +overlayPath C:\\Server1\n  - Please note that the working directory for the server must still be set to\n    the main installation directory.\n  - Also please note that if your overlayPath contains spaces you will need to\n    quote the path in the arguments in one of these ways:\n    - bf1942_w32ded.exe +overlayPath 'c:\\path with spaces\\server1'\n      (single quotes)\n    - bf1942_w32ded.exe +overlayPath &quot;&quot;&quot;c:\\path with spaces\\server1&quot;&quot;&quot;\n      (note that these are three double quotes)\n\n\n\n==================================================================\nPatch 1.5\n==================================================================\nCLIENT FIXES\n-No more swapping CD's.  Any installed Battlefield 1942 expansion pack \n or community mod can be played using any Battlefield CD. \n-Fixed an issue that would cause severe lag when going from a vehicle ladder \n directly into a vehicle position.
