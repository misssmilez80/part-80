I, II &amp; III \n\nNotes: \n\nThis is truly one of the very best George Michael bootlegs to ever surface. This was recorded during the height of his commericial success, on the wildly successful Faith Tour. George is at the very top of his game vocally, even hitting the high notes in &quot;One More Try&quot; with ease. &quot;Hard Day&quot; comes off much better here than it does on record, making for an excellent lead-off track. The Stevie Wonder cover, &quot;Love's In Need Of Love Today&quot; is a song that suits George's voice perfectly and he really shines on it. The hit duet with Aretha Franklin, &quot;I Knew You We're Waiting&quot; is performed solo here, and you really don't miss Aretha, George nails it on his own. &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; is milked to the extreme, with an extended saxaphone solo that really takes this epic to the next level. Deon Estus, bass player and backround vocalist is a standout on this recording, laying down a solid groove throughout the show. The 1996 unplugged shows are excellent, but this recording, with a full band is very, very special. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. Please share your GM bootlegs if you have. Happy Holidays! \n\n- Ryan &quot;Lil King&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee5c02db8bc67d4111ec7950269f55d6b23b2ad9","amp;dn":"George+Michael+-+1988+Soundboard+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee5c02db8bc67d4111ec7950269f55d6b23b2ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,92,2,219,139,198,125,65,17,236,121,80,38,159,85,214,178,59,42,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
