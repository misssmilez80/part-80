Since bipedality has long been considered one of the defining characteristics of modern humans, such a discovery raises fascinating questions about genetics, society and the evolutionary history of our species. Is this the anthropological find of the millennium or simply a unique medical case? In this moving documentary, NOVA sets out to unravel the controversy and meet the individuals who have captured the imagination of scientists around the world. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 25s 185ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 005 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 133 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591f159cc372e2eaa74fb0684887a35bcffe2885","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova-Family+That+Walks+On+All+Fours.S37E04.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591f159cc372e2eaa74fb0684887a35bcffe2885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,31,21,156,195,114,226,234,167,79,176,104,72,135,163,91,207,254,40,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
