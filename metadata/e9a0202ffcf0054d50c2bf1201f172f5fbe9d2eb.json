In the Neil Young biography, Shakey, Neil Young attributes his guitar style to the influence of John Kay; both are Canadians.\n\nAfter the Expulsion of Germans after World War II and the annexation of the northern part of East Prussia by the Soviet Union, Kay's mother also fled the Soviet occupied East Germany in 1948 to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song &quot;Renegade&quot; on the album Steppenwolf Seven). Young Joachim had listened to the music broadcast by the American Forces Network before moving to Canada in 1958.\n\nHe joined a blues rock and folk music group known as The Sparrows in 1965, which had moderate success in Canada before moving to California, augmenting its line-up and changing its name to Steppenwolf in 1967. With more aggressive music, that pioneered hard rock and heavy metal, Kay's Steppenwolf had international success with songs such as &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;The Pusher&quot;, and &quot;Rock Me&quot;, which was multiplied by the use of &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; and &quot;The Pusher&quot; in the 1969 movie Easy Rider.\n\nKay recorded both as a solo artist and with Steppenwolf during the late 1970s, and is wrapping up Steppenwolf's 40th year of touring with a final gig in October 2007.\n\nIn 2004 he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame, in recognition of his early years as a Canadian citizen and the beginnings of his musical career in Toronto. Whereas any celebrity that meets criteria can finance their way into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, inductees to Canada's Walk of Fame are selected via a supervising committee, and thus must earn their honour. John Kay was present at the induction ceremony in Toronto, and reiterated his strong affection for Canada.\n\nKay suffers from congenital achromatopsia, a defect of the eyes which causes legal blindness, complete colorblindness, and increased sensitivity to light, the latter of which being the reason he wears his trademark sunglasses to combat. Despite this condition, he is an avid videographer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9a0202ffcf0054d50c2bf1201f172f5fbe9d2eb","amp;dn":"John+Kay++My+Sportin%C3%82%C2%B4+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9a0202ffcf0054d50c2bf1201f172f5fbe9d2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,160,32,47,252,240,5,77,80,194,191,18,1,241,114,245,251,233,210,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
