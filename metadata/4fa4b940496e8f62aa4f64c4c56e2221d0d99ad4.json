These 2 friends decided that its time for a new true Luciferic Blackmetal band to arise. The music shall be fast, brutal and disqusting. The essence of the lyrics shall be Nordic Hatred towards those who a 1000 years earlier had slayed and forsed their ancestors to believe in a christian and false god. A bunch of songs were written and 3 got recorded and became the first Nidrike demo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gneras HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gborgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nAfter recieving almost overwhelming feedback from fans and labels Nidrike decided to sign with the american underground label, Black Plague Records! A fullenght album is to be recorded and released under a Luciferic Moon! But to make this as good as possible Nidrike decided to let Liedheim do the drums and Aamoth also from Vanmakt put his hellish patterns of hatred on some of the guitar tracks! Now Nidrike is ready to record a true underground album that will smash everyone into pieces! Grim melodies with a base of attacking drums that will mangle all the demons up from hell! Be prepared for the Doom to come!\n\nFrom the depths of hatred Nidrike has recorded their debutalbum entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlodsarvÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
