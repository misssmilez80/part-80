His aim was to enter the work in a school playwriting contest, never anticipating that it would bring him worldwide acclaim at the age of twenty-three. As its subtitle indicated, he wrote the play as a parodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;a pseudo-classical tragifarce in a bastard French tradition&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in the new, avant garde French theater of Arthur Adamov, Eugene Ionesco, and Samuel Beckett. It was this subgenre of the theater that, in 1961, Martin Esslin labeled the Theatre of the Absurd.\n\nKopitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Oh Dad has the distinction of being a relatively rare phenomenon: an extremely successful first work staged in New York by a new and virtually unknown playwright. When Oh Dad opened at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Phoenix Theatre on February 26, 1962, beginning a run of 454 performances, it already had a production history, both in the United States and abroad. In fact, the play was published in 1960, the same year in which it was first staged at Harvard and then, professionally, at the Agassiz Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was during itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s run at the Agassiz that it came to the attention of the staff of the Phoenix. Before the Phoenix mounted its extremely successful production, however, the work had already been staged in London, where it was directed by Frank Corsaro and starred Stella Adler as Madame Rosepettle.\n\nIn the New York staging, directed by Jerome Robbins, an experienced cast headed by Jo Van Fleet as Madame Rosepettle, Austin Pendleton as Jonathan, and Barbara Harris as Rosalie kept audiences delighted, making it a major box-office success. It also garnered the Vernon Rice and Outer Circle Awards, both significant honors.\n\nThe offbeat, dysfunctional charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially Madame Rosepettle and her son, JonathanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ caused some critics to complain about a lack of serious purpose in the play as well as its derivative elements, but the farcical and fanciful treatment of an overly-protective, domineering mother and her neurotic son gave New York and European audiences little pause. Most commentators could not argue with success and found the play a engaging spoof of everything from Tennessee Williams's Rose Tattoo to Freudian psychology.\n\nThe play moved to Broadway:\n\nMorosco Theatre, (8/27/1963 - 10/5/1963) \nPreview: Aug 26, 1963   Total Previews: 1 \nOpening: Aug 27, 1963       \nClosing: Oct 5, 1963   Total Performances: 47 \n\nOpening Night Production Credits \n\nProduced by Roger L.

The Other Woman \n\nThe film has many flaws of sex comedies of late the 1960s 'camp' period but the most glaring and bad element of this film is undoubtedly the unfunny and intrusive  'narration' by Jonathan Winters.  The would probably have been a film that did not stand the test of time in any case but it is Winters' performance that truly drags this vehicle down.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f85d0de796837df08c6f4f09448abcac07e7cf","amp;dn":"Oh+Dad+Poor+Dad+...++%28VHS%29+%5B1967%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f85d0de796837df08c6f4f09448abcac07e7cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,248,93,13,231,150,131,125,240,140,111,79,9,68,138,188,172,7,231,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
