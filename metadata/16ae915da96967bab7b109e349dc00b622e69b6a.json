Just as most people awaits Windows 7 RTM with build version of 7300 (as Windows 7 Beta is 7000 and Windows 7 RC is 7100), or 7272, as the natural increment to July 13th, the much rumored official RTM date, the word is leaked that Windows 7 RTM will be build 7600, with version number of 6.1.7600.16384 and full build string of 6.1.7600.16384.win7_rtm.090710-1945, if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s indeed the final gold RTM code for Windows 7.\n\nAccording to:\nhttp://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/07/13/download-windows-7-rtm-build-7600-16384-x64-64-bit-iso-images/\n\nWindows 7 RTM Build 7600 no longer able to use Windows 7 Beta product keys or Windows 7 RC product keys to activate.
