I have a reason to believe that the original torrent uploaded about 8-9 hrs ago was corrupt.  \n\nIn order to make a solid MONO remix, the reference of sort is needed.  This time, the title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey BulldogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the double album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll [US pressing/MONO] was taken as a starting point.  The title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey BulldogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (MONO) was mixed rather unusually. The mid frequencies were sort of suppressed (1-3khz) making the vocals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpushed backÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while the GeorgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar and PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bass take the center stage.  The frequency matrix was copied and applied to all tracks.  In my opinion, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey BulldogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the best mono mix ever made.  However, the re-master version in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeatles in Mono, Past Masters 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the punch and the kick of the bass, and the whole impression is sort of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œairyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because of the unreasonable high frequencies boost.  \n\nThe process:\n\n1. Applied the frequency curve of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Hey BulldogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ MONO  to all tracks \n2.  Stereo converted to mono by simply mixing lef and right into a single center channel at 50%\n3. Mid compression at about 10khz\n4. Re-sampled for the smallest possible file siye while preserving the authenticity of frequency response and dynamics.  \n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to listen to this on a high end surround sound system, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re bound for a major disappointment.  Basic two channel stereo system will be more than enough to give you an exceptional listening pleasure.  \n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3adfad297844351f652edb813a18200af158e6f5","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Yellow+Submarine+%5Bmono+remix+2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3adfad297844351f652edb813a18200af158e6f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,223,173,41,120,68,53,31,101,46,219,129,58,24,32,10,241,88,230,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
