Another man offered an old\n        patent medicine device that &quot;cures&quot; syphilis. A man complains\n        that he got too little money for his DVD pawn, but accuses\n        security of manhandling him. A woman tries to sell Courvoisier\n        bottles designed by Ert, but their boxes were damaged in a\n        flood. A couple try to exchange the woman's earrings for a\n        promise ring, except that the earrings, which her boyfriend said\n        he spent $1000 on, was fake. A man, facing eviction, pawns his\n        Christopher Radko Christmas ornaments, even though Les usually\n        doesn't buy ornaments.\n                            \n                                 \n                                                  \n      \n            \n                                                     \n                                                 \n                                                                      \n\n      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
