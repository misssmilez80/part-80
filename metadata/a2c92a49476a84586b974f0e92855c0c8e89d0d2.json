It can be used to prepare a standalone system or for integration with an existing MythTV network. Unlike similar projects, Mythbuntu keeps close ties with Ubuntu and all development is given back to Ubuntu. This architecture allows simple conversions from a standard desktop to a Mythbuntu machine and vice versa. The development cycle of Mythbuntu closely follows that of Ubuntu, releasing every six months with Ubuntu releases.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c92a49476a84586b974f0e92855c0c8e89d0d2","amp;dn":"Mythbuntu+9.10+Desktop+I386","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c92a49476a84586b974f0e92855c0c8e89d0d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,201,42,73,71,106,132,88,107,151,79,14,146,133,92,12,142,137,208,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
