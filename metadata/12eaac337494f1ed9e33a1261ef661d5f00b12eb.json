She also stated that two songs written and performed by Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, would be included in the film as well.[8] The soundtrack also includes two songs by Paramore[3], with their new song &quot;Decode&quot; being the soundtrack's lead single, the debut of a new song by Mute Math from their forthcoming sophomore album, and a new original song for the film by Perry Farrell.[9] &quot;Flightless Bird, American Mouth&quot; by Iron &amp; Wine was chosen for inclusion in the movie by star Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan.[10] Noticeably absent from the soundtrack is &quot;15 Step&quot; by Radiohead, which plays as the movie ends and during the first half of the credits.\n\n\nTrack listing\n&quot;Supermassive Black Hole&quot; (Muse) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31 \n&quot;Decode&quot; (Paramore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21 \n&quot;Full Moon&quot; (The Black Ghosts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50 \n&quot;Leave Out All the Rest&quot; (Linkin Park) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19 \n&quot;Spotlight&quot; (Twilight Mix) (Mute Math) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n&quot;Go All the Way (Into the Twilight)&quot; (Daniel Newman and Perry Farrell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 \n&quot;Tremble for My Beloved&quot; (Collective Soul) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n&quot;I Caught Myself&quot; (Paramore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n&quot;Eyes on Fire&quot; (Blue Foundation) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01 \n&quot;Never Think&quot; (Robert Pattinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30 \n&quot;Flightless Bird, American Mouth&quot; (Iron &amp; Wine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n&quot;Bella's Lullaby&quot; (Carter Burwell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19 \n\n\n\n\n\ne19ht47wo1.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12eaac337494f1ed9e33a1261ef661d5f00b12eb","amp;dn":"TWILIGHT+%5Bmovie+soundtrack%5D+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12eaac337494f1ed9e33a1261ef661d5f00b12eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,234,172,51,116,148,241,237,158,51,161,38,30,246,97,213,240,11,18,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
