Robb - Eve Dallas 14 - Interlude in Death-viny.pdf\n\nIn early spring of 2059, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is called off planet to face a grueling ordeal - giving a seminar at the largest police conference of the year, to be held in a swanky resort. A resort which just happens to be owned by her husband, Roarke, of course.\n\nEven though Eve can't quite see it that way, it's supposed to be at least partly a vacation. But work intrudes in the form of a bloody homicide, and Eve is off and running. The case is complicated by Eve's personal history with the victim - and by the killer's history with Roarke. As danger closes in and the body count rises, Eve must find a way to stop the cycle of violence and revenge, and shove the past back where it belongs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b82dc0a3aa4dc5948c202906525c11dc3a4a2949","amp;dn":"J.D.+Robb+-+Eve+Dallas+14+-+Interlude+in+Death-viny.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b82dc0a3aa4dc5948c202906525c11dc3a4a2949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,45,192,163,170,77,197,148,140,32,41,6,82,92,17,220,58,74,41,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
