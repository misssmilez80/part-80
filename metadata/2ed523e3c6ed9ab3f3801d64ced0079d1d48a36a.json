With creative input from the band, we've assembled this Herculean\nfive-CD collection containing over six hours of music from throughout Yes'\ncareer. In A Word charts Yes' musical journey with 55 timeless tracks,\nincluding hits like &quot;Roundabout,&quot; &quot;I've Seen All Good People,&quot; and &quot;Owner\nOf A Lonely Heart,&quot; plus rarities and songs from Anderson Bruford\nWakeman Howe.\n\nAnd since Yes' music and Roger Dean's images have been a classic\ncombination since the dawn of the '70s, we've commissioned brand-new\ncover art from the legendary designer. A full-color, 80-page book contains\noceans of rare photos, plus essays by Yes experts Chris Welch and Bill\nMartin, and tributes by noteworthy Yes fans such as Les Claypool of Primus\nand Writer-Filmmaker Cameron Crowe.\n\nA monument to rock's outer reaches, In A Word: Yes (1969- ) is the most\ndefinitive Yes retrospective ever produced.\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n   1.
