The player assumes the role of a foot soldier who can wield various firearms, of which two at a time can be carried; throw grenades and other explosives; and use other equipment as weapons. A player close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow. A character can take three stances: standing, crouching, or prone; each affects rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. The player can dive prone from a standing position when running. The player can momentarily sprint but will then grow tired. The screen glows red to indicate damage to a player\\'s health, which goes away over time. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player to flee or throw it back. Among the game\\'s weapons are crossbows with bolts and explosive ammunition, Dragon\\'s Breath rounds and ballistic knives.\n\n\nThat being said, here is the ISO for xbox 360.  I ripped it from my USB Harddrive after installing the game, in order to use the file you need to convert it from iso to GoD using ISO2God.exe\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ea08e8fc9c3783cb156019168abc4297ded9ea","amp;dn":"Black+ops+ISO+%7C%7C+USB+Extraction+%7C%7C+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ea08e8fc9c3783cb156019168abc4297ded9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,234,8,232,252,156,55,131,203,21,96,25,22,138,188,66,151,222,217,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
