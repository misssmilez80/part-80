The mania begins as soon as several girls are nominated for prom queen, with one notable exception ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the hateful and despicable Cherry has not been nominated, and man, is she angry. Cherry takes to murdering a handful of the candidates, while a trio of relatively ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ teens finds itself embroiled in a web of unrelated kidnapping, murder and basic teenage mischief.\n\n Brooke Balderson ...

Thelma Melvins \n\nBeth, Julie, and Scott have the school principal bound and gagged in their basement, the result of the vile educatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s licentious advances on Beth. Unfortunately, a truly bizarre prom queen candidate named Terra (Scott refers to her as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most absurd person) has witnessed the crime, and promptly blackmails her way into the twisted proceedings. Julie decides to hire Cherry to kill Terra, partially because CherryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been murdering people left and right, anyway and partially because Cherry hates Terra. (Several of the movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more entertaining moments come as profane and insane screaming matches between Cherry and Terra.) \n\nOn a technical level, Pep Squad is quite impressive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially considering the relatively meagre budget the filmmakers had to work with. As a director, Balderson keeps things moving along at a brisk pace and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be hard pressed to find another low-budget movie that crams in as much off-kilter colour as Pep Squad does. For the most part, the cast is a pleasant surprise as well; Brooke BaldersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rabid performance as Cherry could sear the paint off your walls (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a compliment), and the lovely Summer Makovkin (as Julie) delivers a smart, sexy performance as well. The highlight of the cast is Amy Kelly as Terra, an actress who seems to think sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing Divine in a John Waters-directed biopic. KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance is strange, obnoxious and over-the-top hilarious. \n\nIf you were under the impression that topics like pedophilia, kidnapping, mass murder, and teenagers blowing each other away with shotguns are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtoo realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for comedy, then itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too bad that nobody told Steve Balderson. Pep Squad rockets from shock to jolt to outright assault, never once pausing to apologize, and the result is a solid little ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsick jokeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of a comedy, one that would never be released by a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ studio (seeing as how the big studios generally like their black comedies to come ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œalready evisceratedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a la Jawbreaker or Teaching Mrs. Tingle). \n\nMuch like those really nasty jokes you reserve for only your closest friends, Pep Squad will probably be most appreciated by those with an open mind and a penchant for sick humour that knows no boundaries. If this movie doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t offend the living hell out of you, I bet youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have a ball with it. \n\n\nB-Movie Film Festival \n \n2000  Won B-Movie Award Best Screenplay Steve Balderson \n2000  Won B-Movie Award Best Supporting Actress Brooke Balderson \n2000  Nominated B-Movie Award Best B-Movie Steve Balderson  \n\nFantasporto \n \n1999  Nominated International Fantasy Film Award Best Film Steve Balderson \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5880731af4510100cb70d4a3d754e5baca731c06","amp;dn":"Pep+Squad+%5B1998%5D+Steve+Balderson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5880731af4510100cb70d4a3d754e5baca731c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,128,115,26,244,81,1,0,203,112,212,163,215,84,229,186,202,115,28,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
