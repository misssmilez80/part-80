Sweet acoustic rhythms &amp; vocals that send you. Don't listen if you are afraid to close your eyes, lean your head back and probably tap your hands or feet while you are digging it. Four guys, 5 or 6 guitars, 1 banjo, 1 violin, a harmonica and a kazoo... you are going to love it. \n\nSaw them playing at Pier 39 on a Sunday in San Francisco... totally captivating. Bought the CD for five bucks (and a tip) and they asked that it be shared... my pleasure. \n\nYou can find them on myspace here \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c690de61b251fac22779ce3328f418949ec72c6d","amp;dn":"The+Pioneers+of+Primetime+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c690de61b251fac22779ce3328f418949ec72c6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,144,222,97,178,81,250,194,39,121,206,51,40,244,24,148,158,199,44,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
