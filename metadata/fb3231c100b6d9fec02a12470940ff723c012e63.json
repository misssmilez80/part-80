I modeled it after one of my favorite Emcee's projects &quot;Charles Hamilton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Every Charles Hamilton's Ex-GirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Worst Nightmare Mixtape&quot; with my own little twist. &quot;The Diary&quot; refers to a place where you keep your inner most secrets and feelings (my brain in this case), and the &quot;Pissed Off Rapper&quot; refers to the anger and hurt that has been locked up inside the diary for years that is finally rising to the surface. This tape explains what happened and how I felt about certain females and our different situations. It was created for all of the good men in the world that are always outshined by the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAssholesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and taken advantage of by females who obviously cannot make up their minds, nor know what it is they want when it comes to a partner.  Hopefully, women will learn that all men are in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œassholeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ category that they tend to group us in; the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œN***** ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t s*** categoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Some of us actually are good dudes that want nothing more than to give you the world, and treat like a queen on a pedestal. So please remember women, that maybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the guys that you f*** with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthat ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t s***ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and not everything that has a penis. Anyhow, thank you for downloading and listen to it. I really appreciate it. It is probably the BEST WORK I have ever done as a solo artist, and it is ABSOLUTELY FREE. I produced 11/15 beats and 3 by Raw-T and 1 by Reek Nas. Each track is a sample from the collection of Final Fantasy video games. Enjoy! \nThank you for the support, I appreciate each and every one of you. You are the reason that I keep doing this. Be on the lookout for my next two projects, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hopeless Romantic Pt. 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ &amp; The Hopeless Romantic Pt. 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nPhilosophy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb3231c100b6d9fec02a12470940ff723c012e63","amp;dn":"The+Diary+Of+A+Pissed+Off+Rapper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb3231c100b6d9fec02a12470940ff723c012e63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,50,49,193,0,182,217,254,192,42,18,71,9,64,255,114,60,1,46,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
