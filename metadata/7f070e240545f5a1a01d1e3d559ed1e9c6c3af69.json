With Sponge you     \n    can reclaim your disk space by:                                       \n                                                                          \n    * Removing applications. Sponge will tell you what applications       \n      are installed on your system, how much space they use, and where    \n      they are located. If you find any applications you no longer        \n      need, Sponge will remove them safely and swiftly for you.           \n                                                                          \n    * Sweeping disk hogs. If you're running out of disk space but         \n     don't know where to start cleaning up, let Sponge show you which     \n      files and directories take up the most space. Once you've           \n     tracked them down, let Sponge conveniently swipe them off your       \n      disk.                                                               \n                                                                          \n    * Finding duplicates. With all the attachments, memos, letters and    \n      other documents with which we are flooded in today's world, it's    \n      easy to lose track where we've saved what. Sponge makes finding     \n      and deleting duplicate files a breeze.                              \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Use our keymaker to register the application.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
