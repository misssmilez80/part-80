(You will have to add it to the list of disks available but this just takes a second.) Then you select the Puppy hard disk Puppy4 2.6.25 and away you go. \nYou will have to tweek xVM a little to set the system up with another network card if you want to get on a network as it has the one from my laptop as installed on this image.\n\nFor people into different OS try a search for OS2 Warp4. This is also a setup for VirtualBox but has to be installed from the floppy images I included or you could even install it on an old machine for real!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177793a2a744c4592456148c7e177a25f62abcd9","amp;dn":"Puppy4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177793a2a744c4592456148c7e177a25f62abcd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,119,147,162,167,68,196,89,36,86,20,140,126,23,122,37,246,42,188,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
