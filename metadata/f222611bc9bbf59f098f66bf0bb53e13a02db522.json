Waysted also spawned same drama as UFO, so for this record drummer Andy Parker was out, but Pete Way got another UFO member Paul Chapman on the six-string.\n\n&quot;The Good the Bad the Waysted&quot;is a display in good time Rock N' Roll. It's raw, rough, has tons of attitude and just great melodies with Hang Em High and Land That's Lost Love as album highlights. Paul Chapman fits the band perfectly and Waysted also varies the song writing - Manuel is an extended rocker clocking at 6 minutes with an amazing middle play.\n..............\nWelcome to the Waysted, wild west rock 'n' roll shoot-out...\n\nThe Good The Bad The Waysted, is a down 'n out recording of dirty raunch 'n' roll that kicks ass from start to close. Throughout the seedy album, former UFO bassist Pete Way and his wrecked mates, vocalist Fin and indestructible guitarist Paul &quot;Tonka&quot; Chapman, come out with their guns blazing. _The Good The Bad The Waysted_ is back alley, loud 'n' proud, lean 'n' mean', gritty rock 'n' roll for the whiskey drinkin' masses. Fins raw vocals are tough as nails, as the Waysted boys bring down the walls with bad ass tracks, which includes album opener &quot;Hang 'em High&quot;, plus &quot;Dead on Your Legs&quot;, &quot;Rolling Out the Dice&quot;, &quot;Crazy 'bout the Stuff&quot;, and a full-tilt cover of Chuck Berry's Around and Around&quot;. \nFcuk off...
