It's been just over two and a half\nyears since ErES was established and in that time in the scene we've\nproduced many quality releases because of our attitude not only as a\ngroup -- but as individuals each member of the group has shown\nrespect and friendship and in return offers loyalty that could only be\nfound when part of a tight-knit family. We are not a release\nmachine and never intend to be. We have a relaxed, yet hard-working\nattitude towards producing releases and you can see this through all\nof our current (and future) releases.\n\nIf you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of\nwe have listed below the currently open positions and things we\nrequire:\n\nExperienced reversers for all Operating Systems\nSkilled coders\nQuality suppliers\nGood 100Mbit EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with\nAnything else you think we might like\n\ne r e s g r p  a t  g m a i l . c o m\n\nascii/nfo:...........ph0SiLK    updated:............16.04.2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74da0438f1f1b0cb9c9915afb5289347a33f642c","amp;dn":"Angry.Birds.v1.5.2.Cracked.GAME-ErES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74da0438f1f1b0cb9c9915afb5289347a33f642c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,218,4,56,241,241,176,203,156,153,21,175,181,40,147,71,163,63,100,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
