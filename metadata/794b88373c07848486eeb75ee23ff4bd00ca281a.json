The album garnered the late talent a well-deserved truckload of awards, and served as a fitting testament to his enormous skills as a blues guitarist. It left his fans around the world wanting just a little bit more, though, a desire fulfilled by Songs From The Road. Assembled by bassist Alec Fraser - Healey's musical foil for his blues and his jazz projects alike for over a decade - Songs From The Road offers up eleven inspired and energetic performances of vintage pop, rock, and blues music taken from three different concerts. The bulk of the set, five songs, are from Healey's August 2006 appearance at the notable Notodden Blues Festival in Norway. Four songs were taken from a May 2007 show in London, while a pair are courtesy of Jeff Healey's Roadhouse club in Toronto, circa November 2007. - blues.about.com\n\n\nmp3   320kbps\n\n\nit's wicked","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:794b88373c07848486eeb75ee23ff4bd00ca281a","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Jeff+Healey+-+Songs+From+The+Road+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"794b88373c07848486eeb75ee23ff4bd00ca281a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,75,136,55,60,7,132,132,134,238,183,94,226,63,244,189,0,202,40,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
