ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1481?) was a poet-saint of Gujarat, India, notable as a bhakta, an exponent of Hindu devotional religious poetry. He is especially revered in Gujarat, where he is acclaimed as its Adi Kavi (Sanskrit for &quot;first among poets&quot;). His bhajan &quot;Vaishnav Jan To Tene Re Kahiye...&quot; is Mahatma Gandhi's favorite and has become synonymous to him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9073d6226a54ac930a2c584a6e9aa37d45404960","amp;dn":"Prabhatiya+From+Narsinh+Maheta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9073d6226a54ac930a2c584a6e9aa37d45404960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,115,214,34,106,84,172,147,10,44,88,74,110,154,163,125,69,64,73,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
