His illustrator and only friend, Rudy, dies after a fabulously successful collaboration on &quot;Marty, the Beaver.&quot; Henry is under contract to produce another Marty book for Christmas sales. His publisher, Arthur Planck, assigns penniless, lovelorn illustrator Lucy Reilly to work with Henry. She's sought by her ex-boyfriend Jeremy, who dumped her two years ago but shows up apologetic, having dedicated his new book to her. She and Henry go to a house on the shore to work. Will love bloom amid the rocks, or is Henry a bump on Lucy's road to Jeremy? Rudy's voice, from the grave, gives Henry counsel.&quot;\n\n=========================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490579/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490579/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e140e2fd1563cf65ecbd2f167fecc5c0dbecdbb","amp;dn":"Dedication.2007+-+Arabic+Subs+Hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e140e2fd1563cf65ecbd2f167fecc5c0dbecdbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,20,14,47,209,86,60,246,94,203,210,241,103,254,204,92,13,190,205,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
