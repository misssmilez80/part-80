They had met at Reznor's Los Angeles rental home, the house where the Manson Family killed Sharon Tate and others. Tim Leary had brought RU along to a housewarming party there and RU gave Reznor a demo tape of his band, called Mondo Vanilli. Reznor quickly signed the band to his then-nascent Nothing Records. Unfortunately, this great work of curious and quirky synth-industrial-pop, titled &quot;IOU Babe,&quot; never made it to the record stores. Almost two decades later, Mondo Vanilli has officially released &quot;IOU Babe&quot; for free online","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e426b557695aaa693a443b54636aa075796128c1","amp;dn":"Mondo+Vanilli+-+IOU+Babe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e426b557695aaa693a443b54636aa075796128c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,38,181,87,105,90,170,105,58,68,59,84,99,106,160,117,121,97,40,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
