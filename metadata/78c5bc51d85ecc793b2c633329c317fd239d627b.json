The distribution has been built and customised from a minimal Ubuntu install. The distribution has been designed to offer a good balance of speed and functionality. CrunchBang Linux is currently available as a LiveCD; however, best performance is achieved by installing CrunchBang Linux to your hard disk.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nSpeed\nCrunchBang Linux has been reported to be a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½A Faster UbuntuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. While CrunchBang Linux is not primarily designed for old systems, it has been reported to operate very well where system resources are limited. Once installed, CrunchBang Linux should boot-up and operate much faster than a regular Ubuntu installation.\n\nCompatibility with Ubuntu\n\nWith the exception of a few packages, CrunchBang Linux is built entirely from packages available from the Ubuntu repositories. CrunchBang Linux uses the same APT package management tools and update manager. CrunchBang Linux comes with all the lastest package updates installed and ready to go. If you are already familiar with Ubuntu, you should have no trouble working with CrunchBang Linux.\n\nEase of use\n\nCrunchBang Linux comes with the ability to play most popular media formats, including but not limited to MP3, DVD playback &amp; Adobe Flash. CrunchBang Linux also comes with many popular applications installed by default, including but not limited to Firefox 3 web browser, VLC media player, Skype and Deluge BitTorrent Client.\n\nHighly configurable\n\nCrunchBang Linux is infinitely hackable, this is mainly due to the standards compliant light-weight extensible window manager that is Openbox. CrunchBang Linux also comes installed with Conky, the customisable lightweight system monitor; and PCManFM, a very popular and highly configurable file manager.\n\nSans Brownness\n\nFinally, unlike Ubuntu, CrunchBang Linux isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t brown :)\n\n\nCrunchBang Linux 9.04.01 Released\n\nAfter a slight delay and a prolonged testing period, the final builds of CrunchBang Linux 9.04.01 are now available. As the version number suggests, it is based on Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope. As with all previous releases, 9.04.01 has been built from scratch using the Ubuntu MinimalCD. The builds were completed on the 6th July 2009 and contain all security and package updates available at that time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c5bc51d85ecc793b2c633329c317fd239d627b","amp;dn":"CrunchBang+Linux+%5B9.04.01+32bit%5D+crunchbang-9.04.01.i386.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c5bc51d85ecc793b2c633329c317fd239d627b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,197,188,81,216,94,204,121,59,44,99,51,41,195,23,253,35,157,98,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
