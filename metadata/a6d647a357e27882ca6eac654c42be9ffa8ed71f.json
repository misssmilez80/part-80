One was working as a duo creating no worth mentioning song material for almost two years. Only after the joining of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoatlordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in May 2006, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJudasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAncient Blasphemic TyrantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shortly after song writing became more intense. In a short time a couple of songs were written of which five were selected to be the first demo called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNazarene DecomposingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nThe recording-sessions took place in the band..s rehearsal room in two stormy winter nights in december 2006. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAncient Blasphemic TyrantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ had to leave the band because of musical and personal disagreements shortly after finishing the work on the demo in early 2007. In November 2007 &quot;NAZARENE DECOMPOSING&quot; again conjured up the force of Satan to unleash their second storm on mankind: &quot;Ad Maiorem Sathanas Gloriam&quot;-DEMO. The incantation again took place in the band..s rehearsal room and should last for one whole day. One created three songs of unholy Black Metal, which are only avaiable on tape-format. In February 08 Gaap (Ancient Blasphemic Tyrant) returned to the band and amplifies the sound of &quot;NAZARENE DECOMPOSING&quot; better than ever!
