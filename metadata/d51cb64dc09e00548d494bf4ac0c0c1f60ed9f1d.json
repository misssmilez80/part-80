Full DescriptionRecords. Enormously influential in his heyday, he straddled the line between pure honky tonk and smooth countrypolitan stylings, but exuded pure class 100 percent of the time. Young's later life was plagued by alcoholism and personal problems, and he eventually killed himself, but unlike other tragic country figures his legend diminished after his death. Decades down the road, with his Capitol treasure trove criminally under-represented, the country archivist label Bear Family answered fans' prayers with this exhaustive five-disc document of Young's early work.\n\nThe two sides of Young's musical personality are displayed in all their glory here. The smooth balladeer who made Willie Nelson's &quot;Hello Walls&quot; a pop crossover hit, and the hellbent honky-tonker howling out a debt to Hank Williams on &quot;Your Cheatin' Heart&quot; could not have existed without each other, and that dichotomy is played out in a comprehensive and intriguing way throughout THE CLASSIC YEARS\n\nTrack Listing: \n\nClassic Years 1952-62 CD DISC 1:\n \n 1.
