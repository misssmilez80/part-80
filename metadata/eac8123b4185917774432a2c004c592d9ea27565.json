Two men. Three letters. SMD. Electronic pioneers. DJs. Producers. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been tearing up dance-floors around the world for the past few years, but how did their story begin, and where will it endÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦?\n\nBack in the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“90s, James and Jas were studying folklore and physics respectively at Manchester University, while crafting strange electronic music in the spare room of their shared house.
