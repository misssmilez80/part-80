This version of TDL has an improved pacing and comes in a more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdetectiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ style, making The Joker more mysterious.\n\noriginal film name: The Dark Knight\nnew film name : The Dark Knight: Rise and Fall of Harvey Two-Face\nfilm studio name : Warner\nedit crew name : HDP\nDate Original Film Was Released : 2008-07-14\nDate Edit Was Released on FE: 2009-07-04\nOriginal Runtime : 152 minutes\nNew Runtime : 129 minutes\nAmount of time Cut/Added : 23 minutes\n\nCuts removed/added/extended : \nBank Robbery - trimmed not to show joker\nGarage scene - cutout scene from inside of batmobile; cheesy at end of scene is trimmed\nGordon/Batman chat in bank - Ramirez cut out. This was made also not to show him and for better sound changing of BMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice.\nCourt - ending cut, it was too much cliche\nRestaurant - heavy trimmed to see Harvey as idealist\nLau briefing about money - shortened to remove joker\nGambolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death and Love boat removed\nOf course small trims here and there\nTwo little cuts of police shot during Batman kidnaps Lao\nCut out JokerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first message on TV.\nTrimmed HarveyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s party at Bruce.\nShorten bullet test.\nCut out GordonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death with all subplot following.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BatmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own idea to turn in.\nHighway chase - no shots inside the car except two for plot. Few rearrangement of explosions and Batmobile crash. Cut out kids in tunnel. Shortened helicopter fall (too much CG look)\nBatman doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coming to rescue Rachel.\nGordon dinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t try to get Lao and Joker back.\nCut out many of sonar and SWAT shots.\nShorten Ramirez-GordonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife phone call.\nFew little trims at final scene.\nColour correction - Whole movie is a little desaturated and brighten up. Almost in every scene is little colour over and underburn.\nColour correction - Logos are brown in reference to Batman Begins titles\nHighway chase - beginning was two seconds out of sync\nGordonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death - one (i think) last reference deleted\nReplaced new titles for editor and new movie name.\n\nIntention for this fanedit: Removing few subplots makes this movie going really faster. I was trying make Batman more cynic and logical character, Harvey more as idealist. To make it more like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdetective styleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I removed all visible joker until HarveyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s party to make him more mysterious and unknown psycho. To get more natural feelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦all movie was dark, much saturated and yellow/orange feel. Colour correction was applied to make it look more natural.\n\n\nHardware and software information: VirtualDub, Avisynth, Sony Vegas Pro 9.0\n\nAdditional Comment: Just hope you like it\n\nTime needed for the edition: apx. 2 weeks for edit and colour correction, apx 4 months to get VC-1 (HD 1920ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€1080) source working\n\npersons involved: Harman\n\nRelease info:\n1,4GB XviD 1060kbps, 656ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€272, AC3 5.1 448kbps with DRC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6394c53d53b1efa19185b0272e3b664e0030059","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight%3A+Rise+and+Fall+of+Harvey+Two-Face+%28HDP+fanedit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6394c53d53b1efa19185b0272e3b664e0030059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,57,76,83,213,59,30,250,25,24,91,2,114,227,182,100,224,3,0,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
