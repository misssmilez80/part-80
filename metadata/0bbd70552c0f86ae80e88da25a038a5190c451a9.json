Despite being unreleased, the album spawned one single, &quot;The Funeral&quot;.\n\nExclusive Audio Footage was meant to be the debut album of Clipse, after they signed with Elektra Records. The album's first and only single was &quot;The Funeral&quot;. It failed to catch on in any meaningful way, and their label, Elektra Records, decided to indefinitely shelve the album. Clipse were released from their record contract not long afterward.\n \nExclusive Audio Footage also marks the beginning of the Clipse's recording partnership with The Neptunes. Most of the album's content is very similar to the Clipse's recent albums Lord Willin' and Hell Hath No Fury, focusing on their drug dealing pasts, though it was much more &quot;theatrical&quot; and &quot;movie-esque&quot; than either of their recent albums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing                            All tracks produced by The Neptunes\n\n\n\n\n1. &quot;Prayer&quot;     1:03\n \n\n\n2. &quot;Hear Me Out&quot;     2:55\n \n\n\n3. &quot;Power&quot;     3:58\n \n\n\n4. &quot;Interlude&quot;     1:18\n \n\n\n5. &quot;You Don't Even Know&quot; (feat.
