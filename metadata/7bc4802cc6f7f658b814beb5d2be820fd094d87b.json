Ripped from CD at 256kbs, mp3 with front cover thumbnail.\n\nEmerald is a fantastic collaboration featuring two of Narada's most prestigious acts. It pairs Spencer Brewer with Tingstad &amp; Rumbel. It is one of the finest acoustic ambient albums of all time. It is also, like all of the Tingstad &amp; Rumbel discs, timeless. This acoustic treasure is just as fresh and poignant in the new millennium as it was in the late '80s. The lush melodies create romantic atmospheres. The languid pace of the sound design is suitable for relaxation. This disc has many faces, each of which is gorgeous.\n- Authored By Jim Brenholts \n\n1  \t Fisherman's Dream  \t 04:09\n2 \tShadow Dancer \t03:38\n3 \tThe Last Snow Leopard \t03:27\n4 \tTimeless Reunion \t03:19\n5 \tDreamgift \t04:02\n6 \tGigue \t03:56\n7 \tGateway \t04:03\n8 \tEmerald Pavane \t04:03\n9 \tSnowater \t03:38\n10 \tCinderella \t03:02","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc4802cc6f7f658b814beb5d2be820fd094d87b","amp;dn":"Spensor+Brewer%2C+Eric+Tingstad+%26+Nancy+Rumbel+-+Emerald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc4802cc6f7f658b814beb5d2be820fd094d87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,196,128,44,198,247,246,88,184,20,190,181,210,190,130,15,208,148,216,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
