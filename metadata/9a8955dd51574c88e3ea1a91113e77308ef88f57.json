All I did was normalize the gain, supply mp3 tags and create a playlist file.\n\n\n\nThe 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.\n\nThe Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nOn this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts the latest news stories, including the Obama birth certificate fraud, the prospect of impending war brewing in Pakistan under the looming shadow of World War 3, and other important news items as we head into another week.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.

To paraphrase the late William Cooper: \n Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing \n until you've researched it yourself.\n \n !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !! \n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n..........\n\nfolder.jpg courtesy of commenter &quot;Nighted&quot; at the sebaygo1 blog\n..........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8955dd51574c88e3ea1a91113e77308ef88f57","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2011+May+22+SU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8955dd51574c88e3ea1a91113e77308ef88f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,137,85,221,81,87,76,136,227,234,26,145,17,62,119,48,142,248,143,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
