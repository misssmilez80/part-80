The book is structured as a reverse handbook of special function values. It lists over 100,000 eight digit real numbers in the interval (1,0) that arise as the first eight digits of special values of familiar functions. This book should be of interest to researchers in mathematics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb5ac8f17aee17e78ccf485e456d0f4d2030eab","amp;dn":"A+Dictionary+of+Real+Numbers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb5ac8f17aee17e78ccf485e456d0f4d2030eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,181,172,143,23,174,225,126,120,204,244,133,228,86,208,244,210,3,14,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
