Following a chance meeting in 2004, Bishop and NuVynska devoted all their energy from the start on transforming their passion for music into a living, breathing musical entity with a definite idea of where it wanted to go.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was dealing with a traumatic event in my life,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Bishop reveals. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe only comfort I found was in writing music. I poured myself into it and songs started flowing. Once I heard SylvyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, I knew we had to start a band.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWorking through the growing pains of establishing a sound and a solid line-up to execute it, the Scarlet Sins ranks were strengthened with the addition of bassist Tanya Nicklaus. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work-in-progress Alice In Chains meets Black Sabbath gone Black Label Society delivery brought the Sinners noteworthy recognition throughout Ontario and Quebec, quickly turning them into a club staple in their Toronto stomping grounds. Mid-2007 saw the entrance of drummer Elie Bertrand, a skinbashing powerhouse despite her youth that sealed the deal and solidified Scarlet SinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ musical direction.\n\nThe self-titled debut album issued in September 2007 is, quite simply, a feast of heavy guitar riffs, aggressive drums, melodic solos and dark grooves. A defiant mix of styles that stays within the realms of metal, there is something for every fan of distortion-heavy ear-scorching mayhem.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe dark aspect of our music, I guess that comes from us putting all our anger, our angst and sadness into the songs,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says NuVynska, who carries the mood of the album with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the most unique female voicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ according to Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles writer Carl Begai. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe put all our energy into that so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost like therapy. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re generally really happy people outside of those songs.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nProduced by Richard Chycki, who boasts a catalogue of work for acts including Rush, Aerosmith and Simple Plan to name only a few, the album is the equivalent of a sonic freight train. An album is only as good as its players, however, and Chycki agrees he had real talent to work with.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnyone that hears the Sins CD canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bunch of girls,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s such a stereotype, isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it? Really, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re simply a solid, energetic band with good songwriting. Given that they rock and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to play the overt sex card at all.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSince the release of the album, Scarlet Sins have enjoyed recognition outside their regular haunts, and the buzz is getting louder. They put in two shows, including a headline spot, at the Powerbox Festival in Seattle, WA, sharing the stage with legendary metal queen Doro Pesch (ex-Warlock), Vixen and Kittie. Add to this, gigs supporting Buckcherry, Cypress Hill, Ill Scarlett, Helix, April Wine, and Anvil. In June 2008, the band was chosen from 600 Sonicbids applicants for a chance to open for MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e at the Sarnia Bayfest in Sarnia, Ontario. Chosen by the CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e themselves, no less, for a show attended by 16,000 people. In October 2008, the girls found themselves on the Official Entry Ballot for the 51st Grammy nominations four times under Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song for Drown, and Best Hard Rock Performance for Strangelove and Drown.\n\nNow, with a killer album in hand and another one on the way, Scarlet Sins are gearing up to push the envelope even further.\n\nMusic speaks for itself, but when it comes to Scarlet Sins, it shouts in your face.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23e58784238a569250d79b3e31bd627b1c60bf7","amp;dn":"SCARLET+SINS+%28CANADA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23e58784238a569250d79b3e31bd627b1c60bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,62,88,120,66,56,165,105,37,13,121,179,227,27,214,39,177,198,11,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
