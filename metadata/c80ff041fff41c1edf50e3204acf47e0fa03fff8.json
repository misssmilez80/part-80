One reason for this is that many programs leave your computer full of digital garbage when you remove them. Every time you try out a new program and then uninstall it your system gets more and more clogged up with redundant program components that just get in the way and slow things down.\n\nAshampoo Uninstaller 4 completely eliminates this problem. It lets you test software with confidence because you can be sure that no trace of programs you remove are left anywhere on your system. It does this by comparing compact ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAfterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ snapshots that identify exactly where all program components and settings are located. Uninstalling is completely safe, with automatic backups and a special Reinstaller for quickly reinstalling programs with all their settings.\n\nIn addition to uninstalling, you can also use UnInstallerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comprehensive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBefore and AfterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ comparisons to monitor and identify the secret activities of any program ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for example hidden files and Registry keys. Just take a snapshot, run the application that you want to monitor and then take another snapshot. UnInstaller then compares the snapshots and shows you all the changes the program has made anywhere on your system.\n\nSilver Award_webuser.comAshampoo UnInstaller 4 is actually a complete Windows maintenance package with over a dozen powerful tools. It comes with an advanced hard disk defragmenter, a file wiper, a file undeleter, an Internet cleaner, a Windows Registry cleaner, a Windows system restore point manager, file and folder backup and much more. See further below for a full list.\nNew and improved in this version\nAshampoo UnInstaller 4 is now better than ever before, with new features, improved functionality, two new utility modules and a new graphical user interface. Improved UnInstaller\nUninstall performance and accuracy have been further improved, particularly for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstagedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ program installations. This means that programs installed in several logged stages, for example with multiple updates over a period of time, are now removed much more efficiently.\nNew Undeleter and File Wiper\nA powerful undelete tool for recovering accidentally deleted files and a wiper for completely removing all traces of sensitive files from your hard disk have been added to the UnInstaller toolkit in this version.\nImproved Hard Disk Defragmenter\nThe efficient hard disk defragmentation tool has received a major update and now includes boot time defragmentation, automatic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPro-ActiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ defragmentation when the hard disk is idle and multiple drive defragmentation with optional automatic computer shutdown when the process is complete.\nImproved Internet Cleaner\nThe Internet Cleaner deletes all traces of Internet surfing sessions from your computer (all browsers normally save records of everything you view). The new version supports all the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox, and now also allows Firefox users to choose which cookies they want to keep or delete.\nNew graphical user interface\nIn additional to the functional improvements Ashampoo UnInstaller 4 has been given an attractive new graphical user interface that makes the program easier and more intuitive to use.\nOther highlights\nIn addition to the new and improved features Ashampoo UnInstaller 4 continues to offer all the other tools and features that have made it so popular with novice and experienced users alike. Installation Monitor\nThis small system tray tool identifies almost all program installations automatically, logging the entire installation process so that you can remove the program later with the Ashampoo UnInstaller.\nMonitor secret program activities\nJust take a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ snapshot with UnInstaller, run the application that you want to monitor and then take another snapshot. UnInstaller will then show you all the changes the program has made anywhere on your system, including Registry entries, new files, file changes and other changes.\nReinstaller\nGet insurance against changing your mind! Reinstaller reinstalls your removed programs along with all your individual settings so that you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to go through the hassle of configuring everything all over again.\nDrag &amp; Drop Desktop Uninstaller\nJust drag the icon of a logged program onto the desktop icon to remove it from your computer with Ashampoo UnInstaller. Great for getting rid of trial versions quickly.\nFind invalid installation entries\nAdd/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel often contains invalid entries for programs no longer on your system. This tool locates and deletes these entries, freeing up resources on your machine.\nManage system restore points\nWindows has a system for saving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrollbackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ backups of your system called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrestore pointsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that allow you to return your system to an earlier state without losing your personal data (text documents, emails, browser history etc). The restore points manager shows you all your restore points. It also enables you to activate and deactivate automatic restore points, create manual restore points and load restore points to return your system to a previous state.\nRegistry Cleaner\nThe Windows Registry is the central database where both Windows and most programs save all their (and your) settings. Lots of leftover junk data often accumulates here, particularly when you remove programs without Ashampoo UnInstaller. This tool helps you to identify and get rid of this cruft that is clogging up your system.\nManage fonts\nFonts you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use can use up a surprising amount of memory and Windows resources. This tool enables you to view all the fonts on your system with detailed information on each font and remove fonts you no longer require.\nContents of the UnInstaller toolbox\n\n    * Automatic and manual monitoring of program installation\n    * Monitor secret program activities\n    * Remove all traces of programs from your system\n    * Interactive tool for removing programs for which you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have Ashampoo UnInstaller installation logs\n    * Reinstaller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ reinstall programs with all your settings\n    * Drag &amp; Drop uninstaller\n    * Advanced hard disk defragmenter with automatic defragmentation\n    * Windows Registry cleanup tool\n    * Internet cleanup tool, delete all surfing traces\n    * Undelete tool, restore accidentally deleted files\n    * File wiper for secure deletion of files\n    * Find/delete duplicate files tool\n    * Find/delete temporary files tool\n    * Find/delete empty folders tool\n    * Start Menu cleanup tool\n    * Manage Windows services tool\n    * Manage Internet Explorer extensions tool\n    * File and folder backup and restore utility\n    * Font management tool, delete unnecessary fonts\n\n\nMULTI-LANG\n# Operating Systems:\nWindows XP Windows Vista 32 Windows Vista 64 Windows 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c80ff041fff41c1edf50e3204acf47e0fa03fff8","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Uninstaller+4.03-serial+incl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c80ff041fff41c1edf50e3204acf47e0fa03fff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,15,240,65,255,244,28,30,223,80,227,32,74,207,71,224,250,3,255,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
