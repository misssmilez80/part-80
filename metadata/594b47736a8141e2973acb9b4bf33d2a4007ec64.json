This recording showcases Queen in their prime, at the absolute peak of their powers. Most of these renditions of songs are leaps and bounds above the ones heard on Live Killers and, if officially released, could perhaps be up there with the greatest rock live albums of all time. This is essential listening for any fan of rock music.\n\nI'D LIKE TO THANK XUNCAT FOR UPLOADING IT TO MIND WARP PAVILLION\nTHESE ARE THE INFOS FROM HIS ORIGINAL UPLOAD\nQueen - Complete Kampuchea Concert\nLive in London, UK, at Hammersmith Odeon, December 26, 1979\n\nBootleg\n\nLabel: Gipsy Eye 137/138\nMaterial from this show has also been released on the bootleg &quot;Crazy Tour&quot;. It is, however, incomplete and the sound quality is inferior to this one.\n\nAudio Source: Audience recording\n\nSound quality: EX - EX+ for an audience recording. \nTrue lossless files (ripped in burst mode, but that does not affect quality unless there were ripping errors - I have spotted nothing sounding like that in the files). The tracks are expertly mastered, with nicely balanced frequency/amplitude ranges. Quite audible crowd presence that enhances the live feeling without interfering with the clear sound of music.\n\nLineage: Aud ? &gt; ? &gt; Silver Bootleg &gt; CDR (X) &gt; WAV (EAC) [burst mode] &gt; FLAC (Level 8)\n\nArtwork: Front and back artwork included, 160 DPI.\n\nNumber of discs: 2\n\nTotal Running Time: 113:51 (70:47 / 43:04)\n\nInfo: A classic Queen performance, one of their best! Includes Brian's one time performance of Silent Night during his guitar solo.\n\nTracks:\n\nCD 1\n01 - Intro 2:19\n02 - Jailhouse Rock 1:39\n03 - We Will Rock You (fast) 2:58\n04 - Let Me Entertain You 2:59\n05 - Somebody To Love 7:37\n06 - If You can't Beat Them 4:49\n07 - Mustapha 2:49\n08 - Death On Two Legs 3:10\n09 - Killer Queen 1:57\n10 - I'm In Love With My Car 2:04\n11 - Get Down Make Love 5:33\n12 - You're My Best Friend 2:41\n13 - Save Me 4:02\n14 - Now I'm Here 7:05\n15 - Don't Stop me Now 4:16\n16 - Spread Your Wings 7:15\n17 - Love Of My Life 3:57\n18 - '39 3:37\n\nCD 2\n01 - Keep Yourself Alive 7:49\n02 - Guitar Solo (with Silent Night) 6:01\n03 - Brighton Rock 1:11\n04 - Crazy Little Thing Called Love 3:42\n05 - Crazy Little Thing Called Love (Audience singing) 1:14\n06 - Bohemian Rhapsody 5:33\n07 - Tie Your Mother Down 4:42\n08 - Sheer Heart Attack 5:12\n09 - We Will Rock You 2:16\n10 - We Are The Champions 3:44\n11 - God Save The Queen 1:40\n\nFlac fingerprints:\n(use these to check file integrity, and also if you are unsure whether you already have the same files or not - the prints remain the same even if file names and tags are edited, so if you have the same files, the fingerprints will match)\n\nCD 1\n01 - Intro.flac:8209570928a873e2aa53b012409a78e9\n02 - Jailhouse Rock.flac:81545885a349c80a71a2968401624938\n03 - We Will Rock You (fast).flac:d3ea47e88d25f7250151a41fa19c9414\n04 - Let Me Entertain You.flac:b8c083d04b1aca918b14559461bbb59e\n05 - Somebody To Love.flac:876ed1d32011f6cea679266d09a1740e\n06 - If You can't Beat Them.flac:631f23c4721bb67f53a58d9eba6c38e3\n07 - Mustapha.flac:25fa9ebba6423dd6f913fc9042ef8751\n08 - Death On Two Legs.flac:f9a8de954719b6dcbd17793eef3ad990\n09 - Killer Queen.flac:044b3d25a9eb0e10cad0296df46bf986\n10 - I'm In Love With My Car.flac:441c650813fe5bc296eec2a813e8a380\n11 - Get Down Make Love.flac:1a27684802f9eb50ce311d03cd37a94b\n12 - You're My Best Friend.flac:281e38c5baf22e8888d5d010aded7126\n13 - Save Me.flac:5c05df2b7c0dd19fce7bb3a9166f89bf\n14 - Now I'm Here.flac:3020de5327e7e624a6ed9f76178d9be8\n15 - Don't Stop me Now.flac:9ab9213f3988c8991cba0074fc02d65a\n16 - Spread Your Wings.flac:37fc984c45a19189acb4bd1765812588\n17 - Love Of My Life.flac:860118c03b87a4320d4139b6455bd879\n18 - '39.flac:74e0a72ea095b3b45da988b9946287d9\n\nCD 2\n01 - Keep Yourself Alive.flac:887d7f878b504492fa8ef18d1177be71\n02 - Guitar Solo (with Silent Night).flac:836e04e5d388b2f585a63f1f9a159b73\n03 - Brighton Rock.flac:dd0557e58c7b8698fcb96556c2d8b82d\n04 - Crazy Little Thing Called Love.flac:5beec06ae3fb7408cc784fbcc72aab8b\n05 - Crazy Little Thing Called Love (Audience singing).flac:2c5de6c57a2720efb82783efeb12e6be\n06 - Bohemian Rhapsody.flac:f00dff3581e40c2e4270d8764b7a08b8\n07 - Tie Your Mother Down.flac:2d9fb37ec1a2971578502705fefd5f9c\n08 - Sheer Heart Attack.flac:b9aff3f93c9640c6b0d69eb7f2f61c81\n09 - We Will Rock You.flac:fc572b8699ca018a0477bddb71fad450\n10 - We Are The Champions.flac:9aa161598ec179d0ce22aa1c411dfe72\n11 - God Save The Queen.flac:dd11fe25377cc7a9d486de034764daba\n\nTorrent history: I think I got this from Queenzone.
