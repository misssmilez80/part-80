While the title track was a huge radio hit, it is far from the best track on the album.\n\n\n1. All Is Forgiven\n2. One Good Lover\n3. Don't Let Go\n4. Master of the Land\n5. Stand Up\n6. Good Kid\n7. How Dare a Woman\n8. Rock-A-Bye\n9. Love Shut Down\n10. So Far Away \n\n\nAll of my rips are from the original CD and have embedded cover art.  Enjoy!  Please feel free to ask for requests.  If I have them, I will up them.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nPlease help keep this reseed alive!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12d708d521aa88883397abe45f81b784b26a049","amp;dn":"Siren+-+All+Is+Forgiven+%28320k+MP3%29+%7Bsolstars%7D+-+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12d708d521aa88883397abe45f81b784b26a049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,45,112,141,82,26,168,136,131,57,122,190,69,248,27,120,75,38,160,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
