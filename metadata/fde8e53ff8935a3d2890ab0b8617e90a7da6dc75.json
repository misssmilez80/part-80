Now in his early thirties, he has changed his name, his face and his life, leaving behind a past full of deceptions and betrayed ideals. But one can never escape the past and this man, who only wants to lead a normal life as an ordinary cab driver, is pushed back into action by a covert organization headed by the mysterious Mr. Garrett. In order to help them fight crime in all its aspects, Lazarus goes back to being a soldier, albeit now in civilian clothes, accepting a job as a freelance journalist as his cover. Torn between his thirst for action and the longing for an ordinary life, between a past only partly unveiled and a future with no certainties apart from danger, Lazarus embodies a character for the new millennium, neither hero nor anti-hero.\nAnd Eroi [ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeroesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½], the aptly named issue #41, was not surprisingly one of the best-loved episodes ever in the series: a love story suspended between past and present, adolescence and adulthood, which also becomes a deeper reflection on the true meaning of heroism. It is the same reflection which lies at the heart of issue #46, Battesimo di fuoco [ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baptism of FireÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½], another LL classic. There, readers and characters alike cannot help but ask themselves whether it is ever possible to distinguish clearly between good and evil .\nLazarusÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ doubts become our own because, aside from the fictional context he inhabits, he is exactly like the rest of us. And in the end, this is the reason why the title has gained such a cult following among boys and girls of any age. It might also be worth noting how Lazarus was the first leading character in an Italian comic book to use the Internet for his investigations (and very likely one of the first in the world). He has been doing so since the first issue in 1993.\nAde Capone, who is very interested in cyber-culture, has thus added a further cutting-edge dimension to his stories, in the same vein as some of TVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s greatest hits, from The X-Files to 24.\nIn 2003, Ade Capone has signed an important agreement with Wind s.p.a., one of the three biggest Italian telcos, to bring Lazarus Ledd on cellular phones.\nA Lazarus Ledd mobile game will be released in spring 2003. Ade wrote and edited the script and the structure for this Java game produced by Trecision s.p.a., the leading Italian mobile games producer (www.trecision.com).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde8e53ff8935a3d2890ab0b8617e90a7da6dc75","amp;dn":"Lazarus+Ledd+%5BCroatian%5D+060+Drevni+ratovi+-sid+Atilla82","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde8e53ff8935a3d2890ab0b8617e90a7da6dc75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,232,229,63,248,147,90,61,40,144,171,11,134,23,233,10,125,166,220,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
