Wii&quot; and made somewhat of a soundtrack. Some stuff is missing, and the song titles are my own, but it'll suffice. In fact, it was especially difficult to create titles for the songs, seeing as I've never played the game before, but with my knowledge of the Mario universe, and the preset japanese gibberish titles, I think I did pretty well. I've made it very iTunes/Zune friendly, too, as I've already filled in my own custom album art, artist, genre, etc. Anyways enjoy!\n\nIf nobody's seeding, download from here:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36bd6ddd219b0deb096c5a790abc0cd9b5765cd4","amp;dn":"New+Super+Mario+Bros.+Wii+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36bd6ddd219b0deb096c5a790abc0cd9b5765cd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,189,109,221,33,155,13,235,9,108,90,121,10,188,12,217,181,118,92,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
