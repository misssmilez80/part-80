The big hits are treated well, with Paul Simpson's softening of the rough edges in &quot;I Feel for You&quot; making it more of a rolling groove, while Marley Marl presents a minimal house take on &quot;This Is My Night.&quot; Richard Tee's glistening piano is pumped way up on Dancin' Danny D's mix of &quot;I'm Every Woman,&quot; and the lone Rufus track, &quot;Ain't Nobody,&quot; gets a slight update by Frankie Knuckles. The album's highlight, &quot;I Know You, I Live You,&quot; is extended to nearly eight minutes by Tony Humphries, giving the shimmering disco groove plenty of deserved room. The sleepers are where Life Is a Dance really shines. Hank Shocklee takes the slinky duet with Rick James on &quot;Slow Dancin'&quot; and adds that clunky drum sound that made him famous, while &quot;Clouds&quot; presents one of the final true house mixes from ClivillÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s &amp; Cole before going pop and pedestrian with C+C Music Factory. Perhaps a sign of the times, none of the remixers get credited on the outside of the disc and a glossary of terms such as &quot;house&quot; and &quot;def&quot; is included. A few of the tracks sounded dated a couple years after the album's release, but overall the collection shows more restraint and good taste than expected.&quot;\n\n\nNote from uploader: when Warner Bros released this album on CD they sadly didn't bother using the master tapes but instead went for a straight vinyl to CD transfer (most noticeably on tracks like &quot;This Is My Night&quot; and &quot;Ain't Nobody&quot;). What's even sadder is that it's still in print with that sound quality - twenty years later... That said, fantastic album, and so are the original versions, included here for your listening pleasure as &quot;bonus tracks&quot; - and we all love those, don't we....?\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nLife Is A Dance - The Remix Project\n===================================\n01.
