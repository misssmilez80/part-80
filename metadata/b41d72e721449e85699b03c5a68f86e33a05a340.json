Enhancing Your Memory (info)\n      7. Exercising Your Working Memory\n      Focus now on working memoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the most important memory process of all and one that involves manipulating stored information. After an overview of the topic, dive into a series of engaging exercises that use your creativity, your powers of observation, and your heightened awareness to enhance and improve your working memory.\n   7. Exercising Your Working Memory (info)\n      8. Putting Your Senses to Work\n      Imaginative memory techniquesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as mnemonic devices and personal associationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have been used to improve memory for over 1,000 years. Try your hand at some of them right here, including &quot;chunking&quot; numbers to aid in number recall, creating a vivid story to memorize words, drawing free-form designs, and playing mental chess.\n   8. Putting Your Senses to Work (info)\n      9. Enlisting Your Emotional Memory\n      Turn now to an aspect of memory we don't usually consider when thinking about the subject: emotional memory.
