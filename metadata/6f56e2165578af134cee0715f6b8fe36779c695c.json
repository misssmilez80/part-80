If that irritates you, his playing certainly will not. \n\nHere, two movements from Vivaldi's Four Seasons act as bookends to, among other pieces: a Satie GymnopÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©die, exquisitely played, with lovely embellishments near its close; Vaughan Williams's floating Lark Ascending; a stunning, virtuosic Bach solo (never before released); a soft-edged Bach chorale; a soupy, sentimental &quot;Danny Boy&quot;; a slightly overwrought &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;; a piece by Kennedy himself; and a few other surprises. Kennedy's tone is lush and warm, and his emotionalism almost never overwhelms the music. Greatest hits? More like greatest encores. But definitely a terrific 71 minutes of fiddling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f56e2165578af134cee0715f6b8fe36779c695c","amp;dn":"Nigel+Kennedy+-+The+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f56e2165578af134cee0715f6b8fe36779c695c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,86,226,22,85,120,175,19,76,238,7,21,246,184,254,54,119,156,105,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
