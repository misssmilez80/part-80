But, he admits he wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give up on helping her because heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s committed to the well-being of her three young children who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a voice in the drama. He sends recovering addict and former Dr. Phil guest, Brandon, and his mother, Debbie, to stage an intervention in an attempt to save AlexandraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life. Emotions rise as the mother and son prepare AlexandraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family, including her parents, Erin and Marty, and sister, Katherine, for the confrontation. As Marty faces the reality about his daughterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alleged addiction and his deteriorating relationship with her, his emotions get the best of him. Furious, can he compose himself enough to be effective? When Alexandra arrives at the house for what she thinks is a family celebration, is she ready to hear what her family and friends have to say? Can anyone get through to her? Will she agree to treatment?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a37de56e2913d90e80700ef557d04024e547681e","amp;dn":"Dr.+Phil+-+2011.05.24+Alexandra+and+Brandon+The+Intervention+%28Pa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a37de56e2913d90e80700ef557d04024e547681e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,125,229,110,41,19,217,14,128,112,14,245,87,208,64,36,229,71,104,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
