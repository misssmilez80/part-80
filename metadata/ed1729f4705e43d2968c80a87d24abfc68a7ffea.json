Untreated, its bite has a fatality rate of 100 percent, making it a killer among killers on a continent where it is thought that nearly 20,000 people die of snake bites each year, and the residents of Swaziland in southern Africa have suffered losses for generations. With essentially no access to anti-venom, many people turn to traditional healers for help, but their herbal remedies always fail, leaving Swazis feeling fearful and defenseless against one of their nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most infamous killers.\n\nSwaziland resident Clifton Koen doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really care for snakes, but his wife, Thea Litschka-Koen, is crazy about them. With her husbandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sometimes reluctant help, she has endeavored to change attitudes about black mambas and other snakes found in the area. In addition to starting the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only reptile park, devoted to educating the public and providing a refuge for the animals, the two have become the regionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s go-to experts for safe, humane snake removal from homes, schools, resorts and workplaces. In the course of catching and relocating any number of snakes per day, Thea and Clifton give impromptu lessons about the snakes, covering fact and fiction, and do their best to prevent any unnecessary casualties ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ human or reptile.\n\nIn addition to their other efforts, Thea and Clifton developed a program designed to track black mambas in the wild for the first time and to gain new insights into their behavior. With the help of a snake expert from Johannesburg, they were able to surgically insert radio transmitters in a number of captured black mambas, allowing them to follow the snakes after their release. If their research pays off, they may be able to show that their relocations are working, successfully removing snakes from residential areas for the long term, and thereby bringing some relief to the locals and some respite for the snakes.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 54mn 39s 846ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 042 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 133 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed1729f4705e43d2968c80a87d24abfc68a7ffea","amp;dn":"PBS+Nature-Black+Mamba+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed1729f4705e43d2968c80a87d24abfc68a7ffea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,23,41,244,112,94,67,210,150,140,128,168,125,36,171,252,104,167,255,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
