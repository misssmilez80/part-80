Thirty years later it is often voted one of the funniest films ever, topping a Radio Times poll only last month. Comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar celebrates this anarchic British classic, looking at the film's origins, the shoot in Tunisia and its controversial afterlife. The Python film is an absurdist take on the story of Christ, where a man called Brian (played by Graham Chapman) is mistaken for the Messiah and attempts to escape the attentions of his devoted followers; a deft satire on religious intolerance which brilliantly lampooned Biblical epics like Ben Hur.\n\nHigh quality encode.\n\nEncoding: mp3, VBR 158kb/s, Lame v3.96\nSource: iPlayer AAC stream\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed8b64a09f7533d7735f5860a84b189d9535849","amp;dn":"He%5C%27s+Not+The+Messiah%2C+He%5C%27s+A+Very+Naughty+Boy-Monty+Python","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fed8b64a09f7533d7735f5860a84b189d9535849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,216,182,74,9,247,83,61,119,53,245,134,10,132,177,137,217,83,88,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
