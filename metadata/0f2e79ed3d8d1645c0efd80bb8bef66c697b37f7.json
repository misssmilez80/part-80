The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game. The gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought theknew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.\n\nProduct Features:\n\nExtensive single player: Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story.\nComplete two-person co-op: Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay.\nAdvanced physics: Allows for the creation of a whole new range of interesting challenges, producing a much larger but not harder game.\nOriginal music.\nMassive sequel: The original Portal was named 2007's Game of the Year by over 30 publications worldwide.\n \nPC System Requirements:\n \n-OS: Windows 7 / Vista / XP\n-Processor: 3.0 GHz P4, Dual Core 2.0 (or higher) or AMD64X2 (or higher)\n-Memory: 1GB XP / 2GB Vista \n-Hard Disk Space: At least 7.6 GB of Space\n-Video: Video card must be 128 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 2.0b (ATI Radeon X800 or higher / NVIDIA GeForce 7600 or higher / Intel HD Graphics 2000 or higher)\n-Audio: DirectX 9.0c compatible\n\nFeatures:\n-Original game files\n-Freshly extracted game files from Steam (21th April 2011)\n-No Steam or CD Key needed\n-Latest SKiDROW Crack\n-Working COOP\n-Auto-updating feature\n-Ligthning fast installer\n\nCredits:\n- SERiAL EXPERiENCE\n- ThePsyFamily\n- SKiDROW\n\nVisit: www.serialexperience.co.cc - www.thepsyfamily.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2e79ed3d8d1645c0efd80bb8bef66c697b37f7","amp;dn":"Portal+2+%5BSE+%26+PSY%5D+Auto-updating","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2e79ed3d8d1645c0efd80bb8bef66c697b37f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,46,121,237,61,141,22,69,192,239,216,11,184,190,246,108,105,123,55,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
