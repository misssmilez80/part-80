Please review the EP, and spread the word. Plans for the Concept album of The Typewriter is in motion, and Tory will be playing at a theater local to the composer. The songs are played on solo piano by the composer and recorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta.\n\nFrom the composer: Many thanks to everyone for helping with this small, yet significant project. Both shows are really moving forward, especially The Typewriter. Many thanks to my &quot;family&quot; in Costa Rica who were so inspiring to this project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98349c186b7d72f5f79488c16d0acadc01e5a6e2","amp;dn":"Selections+from+The+Typewriter+and+Tory.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98349c186b7d72f5f79488c16d0acadc01e5a6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,52,156,24,107,125,114,245,247,148,136,193,109,10,202,220,1,229,166,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
