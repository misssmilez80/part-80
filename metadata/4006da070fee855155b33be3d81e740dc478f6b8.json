Liz Spocott, a beautiful young runaway slave, suffers a nasty head wound just before being nabbed by a posse of slave catchers. She falls into a coma, and, when she awakes, she can see the futureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from the near-future to Martin Luther King to hip-hopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in her dreams. Liz's visions help her and her fellow slaves escape, but soon there are new dangers on her trail: Patty Cannon and her brutal gang of slave catchers, and a competing slave catcher, nicknamed The Gimp, who has a surprising streak of morality. Liz has some friends, including an older woman who teaches her The Code that guides runaways; a handsome young slave; and a wild inhabitant of the woods and swamps. Kidnappings, gunfights and chases ensue as Liz drifts in and out of her visions, which serve as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of freedom and offer sharp social commentary on contemporary America. McBride hasn't lost his touch: he nails the horrors of slavery as well as he does the power of hope and redemption.\n\nRead by Leslie Uggams.\n\n9 CDs, approximately 11 hours.\n\nUnabridged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4006da070fee855155b33be3d81e740dc478f6b8","amp;dn":"Song+Yet+Sung+by+James+McBride","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4006da070fee855155b33be3d81e740dc478f6b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,6,218,7,15,238,133,81,85,179,59,227,216,30,116,13,196,120,246,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
