He died on December 1, 1581 at Tyburn. Subsequently\nhe was beatified. A grisley footnote is that the ropes used in his quartering were retained and each year are placed on the altar at the mass celebrating his feast day.\n\nThis play views England's Catholic-Protestant divide through the eyes of the poet cleric John Donne.\n\n\n\nCast:\n\nPaul McGann - John Donne\nTimothy West - Jasper Underhill\nJanet Dale - Queen Elizabeth I\nHilary Maclean - Kate\nPip Donahey - Topcliffe\nKim Durham - Ahern\nMarian Kemp - Sylvia\nAlex Jones - Thomas Moore\nChristian Rodska - Birley\nGraham Caulclough - Edgerton\nGerry Hinks - Sphacto\nSean Connelly - Cecil\nFred Dino - Pembroke\nMark Finn - Oxford\nTerry Pearson - Ostler\nMartin Cookson - Priest.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:864499a0e2782b0828760c14d25075eb9d917b57","amp;dn":"Campion%5C%27s+Ghost+-+The+Memories+Of+John+Donne%2C+Poet++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"864499a0e2782b0828760c14d25075eb9d917b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,68,153,160,226,120,43,8,40,118,12,20,210,80,117,235,157,145,123,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
