It was recorded\nat locations in the Bahamas and the United States between July and August 1980\nand was produced by the quartet's long-time collaborator Brian Eno. The album\nentered the Billboard 200 in the US at number 19 and peaked at number 21 on\nthe UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Remain in Light: \n&quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Houses in Motion&quot;. The record was certified Gold\nin the US and in Canada during the 1980s.  The members of Talking Heads wanted\nto make an album that dispelled notions of frontman and chief lyricist \nDavid Byrne leading a back-up band. They decided to experiment with African\npolyrhythms and, with Eno, recorded the instrumental tracks as a series of \nsamples and loops, a novel idea at the time. Additional musicians were frequently\nused throughout the studio sessions. The lyric writing process slowed Remain in\nLight's progress, but was concluded after Byrne drew inspiration from academic\nliterature on Africa. The artwork was crafted with the help of the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology's computers and designing company M&amp;Co.. Following the \nalbum's completion, Talking Heads expanded to nine members for promotional concerts.\nRemain in Light was widely acclaimed by critics. Praise centred on its \ncohesive merging of disparate genres and sonic experimentation.  The record \nhas featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s \nand the best albums of all time. It is often considered Talking Heads' magnum opus.\n\n\nCD ripped using EAC.  Log, cue and covers are included.\n\nFor more on flac:\nxs.vc/eac/index.html\nsourceforge.net\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n \n\n\nTalking Heads - Remain in Light (Audio)\n\n01.
