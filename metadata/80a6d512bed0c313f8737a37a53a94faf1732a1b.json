Indeed it can, if is not about what it is supposed to be about. This fanedit gets rid of a bunch of Hannibal Lecter scenes to turn the focus back on Francis Dolarhyde and Will Graham. Through seamless branching it also comes with 2 very different endings.\n\noriginal film name: Red Dragon\nnew film name : Red Dragon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Manhunter Edition\nfilm studio name : MGM\nedit crew name : CBB\nDate Original Film Was Released : 2002\nDate Edit Was Released : April, 2009\nOriginal Runtime : 124 min\nNew Runtime :104 min / 99 min\nAmount of time Cut/Added : 20 / 25 minutes cut\n\nFanedit details:\nBratt Ratner was for sure not the no.1 choice for this project, but he tried his very best and got an awesome cast and great characters to work with: Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, Edward Norton as Will Graham, Ralph Fiennes as Francis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Tooth FairyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Dolarhyde, Emily Watson as Reba McClane and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds.\nThe rights for all Hannibal Lecter movies belong since ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHannibalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to Dino De Laurentiis and he decided to milk that cow for whatever it takes (and even gave us the atrocious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHannibal RisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, for which he forced Thomas Harris to write the novel and screenplay). De Laurentiis thought that what the audience wanted most of all is to see more Hannibal Lecter, so Ted Tally added additional scenes to the script including him.\nBut Hannibal Lecter as supporting character has the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDoc HolidayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ effect (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Doc HolidayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a supporting character in the Wyatt Earp story and tends to steal the entire show, because he is so charismatic). Remember: 18 minutes screentime in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilence Of The LambsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were enough to earn him the well deserved academy award for best actor in a LEADING role.\nSo what the additional Hannibal scenes really do is to take away from the main story about the investiagtion of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtooth fairyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ murders. This entire part becomes incredibly flat and all the audience does is to wait for more Hannibal scenes, which actually makes the movie lame to watch.\nWhat I did was to get rid of all the unneeded Hannibal scenes to take the focus away from him, starting with the 10 minutes intro, where he was caught and continuing with scenes, where he was teasing Chilton.\nThe result is a totally different movie, although my changes were actually minor. I think this version of Red Dragon is way more in the spirit of the original book and makes all characters (including Hannibal) appear with a lot more impact. Especially the great performance of Ralph Fiennes profits from the changes.\nAnother thing that always bothered me in both movies (Red Dragon and Manhunter) is the original book ending, which I never liked. But I was not sure that the fanedit audience would prefer a new ending without a true showdown (and with the investigation actually not leading to the true defeat of the tooth fairy), so I created 2 versions, one with the original ending and one with a very different ending, which I like a lot better.\nVersion 1 is called FOREHEAD and version 2 is called FACE. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see if you can figure out why that is. ;-)\n\nTo make it possible to have 2 different endings and still a good image quality on a SL DVD, I used seamless branching to present the movie versions. The breaking point is easily spottable and the break can be a tad long, depending on the DVD player, still it works rather well.\n\nThe changes:\n\n    * recolored the entire movie to a less reddish and more cold tone.\n    * cut Hannibal beginning\n    * moved Dolarhyde residence scene to an earlier point (to introduce the tooth fairy earlier to the audience)\n    * cut starting credits\n    * cut first Hannibal visit finale\n    * cut Hannibal cell removing books\n    * cut Hannibal gets soup scene\n    * cut Hannibal cheering to Chilton\n\nface finale:\n\n    * cut entire Dolarhyde showdown scene\n    * cut Hannibal mentioning Dolarhyde showdown scene\n    * cut Chilton announcing Clarice to Hannibal\n\nDVD Details:\n\n    * 104/99 minutes Single Layer NTSC 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with AC3-5.1 audio\n    * LANGUAGES : ENGLISH (5.1), GERMAN (2.0)\n    * SUBTITLES : ENGLISH (selectable)\n    * MENUS : animated with sound\n    * SCENE SELECTION : yes\n    * EXTRAS: 6 Deleted Scenes, Trailer, CBB Overview for all 34 fanedits, Cover &amp; Disc Art : yes, on DVD-Rom part\n\nFanedit history and making:\nWhen my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFirst ContactÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ edit did not work out the way I intended it, I switched to this one. The idea for this fanedit is rather old, but I never got around to actually do it.\nThis fanedit also marks my complete swtich to Sony Vegas as video editor, because I am sick and tired of the Ulead Media Studio Pro 8.0 bugs. The fanedit was created with Ulead, all deleted scenes, menus and the trailer were created with Vegas. Byebye Ulead. I will never return.\nEditing the movie was quite easy, except for the earlier introduction of Francis Dolarhyde and the additional ending. Encoding gave me a hard time because Ulead did not always add interlacing to the progressive source, which I could not get rid off completely (and I tried many times with many different settings, filters and programs) until I switched to the original mpg source (which Ulead can handle very well).\n\nHardware and software information:\nHardware:\n\n    * Windows XP computer\n    * with an AMD phenom II 940 quadcore cpu\n    * and 4 GB of RAM on an ASUS board\n\nSoftware:\n\n    * Ulead Media Studio Pro 8.0 (fanedit editing)\n    * Vegas Video 7.0 (extras editing, 5.1 audio creation)\n    * Cinema Craft Encoder (encoding to mpg)\n    * Virtual Dub (frameserving, resizing, recloring)\n    * Adobe Audition 1.5 (music normalization, additonal music track creation)\n    * Pro Show Producer (start and end credits creation)\n    * Jasc Paint Shop Pro (transparent stills creation for menus, correcting stills for end credits, cover and disc art)\n    * PhotoZoom Pro2 (pro enlarging of images for cover art and menus)\n    * DVD Lab Pro 1.52 (DVD authoring)\n    * Cyberlink Power DVD (previewing)\n    * Irfan View (image resizing)\n    * PGCDemux (to get the audio and video sources from the original DVD structure)\n    * AnyDVD (DVD ripper)\n    * DGPulldown (to change 25fps to 29.97fps)\n    * TMPGxpress (encoding the extras video)\n    * ffmepggui (converting the extras, German and menu audio files to ac-3 2.0)\n    * Auto GK (to get an avi to create the subtitles)\n    * Subrip (to rip the subtitles from the DVD)\n    * Subtitle Workshop (to load and alter the original subtitles)\n\nTime needed for the edition:\nediting: 3 days, extras: 1 day, trailer: 1 day, DVD menus: 2 days, quality checking and further corrections: 20 days.\n\npersons involved: boon\n\nawards:\nwinner of the true fanedit contest for april 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a6d512bed0c313f8737a37a53a94faf1732a1b","amp;dn":"Red+Dragon+-+Manhunter+Edition+%5Bfanedit.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a6d512bed0c313f8737a37a53a94faf1732a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,166,213,18,190,208,195,19,248,115,122,55,165,58,148,250,241,115,42,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
