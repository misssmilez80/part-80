You can easily change this to NAT or Host Only if you desire. A quick ping sweep will show the IP address of the virtual machine.\n\n\nEnjoy and seed.\n\nBecause Life is Black.  -sAsBlack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc0ef2fdaf090d8abe4a0bf7bb4faac059eab5f","amp;dn":"pWnOS+v1.0.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc0ef2fdaf090d8abe4a0bf7bb4faac059eab5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,192,239,47,218,240,144,216,171,228,160,191,123,180,250,172,5,158,171,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
