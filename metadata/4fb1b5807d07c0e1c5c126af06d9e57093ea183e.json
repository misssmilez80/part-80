It relies on standard Apple programming interfaces. Rest knowing that it has been programmed with stability, future-proofing and performance as a requirement.\n\nMac OS X is an amazing operating system in and of itself. Though if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve used more than one screen on Mac OS X you may have noticed how impractical it is to have the menubar on only one monitor.\n\nWhile keyboard shortcuts can help alleviate the issue, they are not the most satisfactory solution to users who are used to selecting items with the mouse/touchpad rather than the keyboard.\n\nThe other issue would be that to go out of your way to select a menu item on another screen takes you away from your point of focus (the working window). MenuPop simply gives you the menu right there on your working window when and where you need it.\n\nMenuPop works very well with most programs. Issues may arise in applications that do not properly supply menu information.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Pop up menu at current mouse location using a hotkey. New for version \n  1.3 is mouse button activation\n\n* Selectable font size (small to extra large) menu items\n\n* Selectable menus to show: Apple menu and Application menuÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â \n\n* Works great with almost every application and all monitors, including   \n  the Cintiq tablet\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X.6 or above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fb1b5807d07c0e1c5c126af06d9e57093ea183e","amp;dn":"MenuPop+v+1.3.1+%2B+SK+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fb1b5807d07c0e1c5c126af06d9e57093ea183e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,177,181,128,125,7,192,225,197,193,38,175,6,217,229,112,147,234,24,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
