The fundamental reason is that Puppy has been built from scratch, file-by-file, and is not based on any other Linux distribution. One of the most amazing features of Puppy is the range of powerful applications yet such tiny size ...and the speed.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.puppylinux.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.puppylinux.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b9a90019819ed60e8647bcb5d104da153a4750","amp;dn":"Puppy+Linux+4.3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b9a90019819ed60e8647bcb5d104da153a4750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,185,169,0,25,129,158,214,14,134,71,188,181,209,4,218,21,58,71,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
