One of the most promising areas has been tangible user interfaces; physical objects directly coupled with digital information. These new interfaces have typically required expensive technologies and complex installation procedures, limiting them to the context of specialized research labs and museums.\n\nTrackmate is an open source initiative to create an inexpensive, do-it-yourself tangible tracking system. The Trackmate Tracker allows any computer to recognize tagged objects and their corresponding position, rotation, and color information when placed on a surface. Trackmate sends all object data via LusidOSC (a protocol layer for unique spatial input devices), allowing any LusidOSC-based application to work with the system.\n\nHome Page - http://www.microsport.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82909da4df41c87cfed4ed36be911039e6b932b9","amp;dn":"TrackMate_v6.33-DIGERATI+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82909da4df41c87cfed4ed36be911039e6b932b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,144,157,164,223,65,200,124,254,212,237,54,190,145,16,57,230,185,50,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
