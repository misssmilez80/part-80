Huge props to Fatal! May all moviegoers obtain HD cameras and decent audio sources! There are VERY FEW subtitles (geographical locations, xformer names, etc)and not anything to worry about if you dont understand german - most words are similar and resemble their english counterpart!\n\nONE universal complaint - i wish this was mono, only left side audio... but this is one of those movies I would otherwise refuse to watch unless it was R5 or greater quailty... and the quality for this release was surprisingly very very good! very enjoyable, BEST RELEASE of this fun... yet frequently corny film - excellent cgi special effects and.... MEGAN FOX! even if her character had no lines whatsoever, she makes this film worth watching... what a savory piece of eye candy she is! \n\nIF YOU LIKE IT - PLEASE SEED IT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8255395e7fe87fcd94ac82c9180f1f52619b89","amp;dn":"TRANSFORMERS+2+%282009%29+%5BTELESYNC+720p+x264+-+FATAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8255395e7fe87fcd94ac82c9180f1f52619b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,130,85,57,94,127,232,127,205,148,172,130,201,24,15,31,82,97,155,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
