There are five levels, and all of them have five    \n    stages, so you get 25 missions all together with constantly raising   \n    severity. After finishing all the levels you can see your actual      \n    High Score, which you can share online with others. You can replay    \n    the game until you reach the perfect state and collect ALL the        \n    stars. You can view a &quot;replay video&quot; after each finished stage.       \n                                                                          \n    Features:                                                             \n                                                                          \n    - 5 Stages                                                            \n    - 25 Missions                                                         \n    - AGON based Online High Score                                        \n    - Video Replay                                                        \n    - Unique Gameplay                                                     \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://iphone.3dmagicbox.com/rollercoasterbuilder.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://iphone.3dmagicbox.com/rollercoasterbuilder.php&lt;/a&gt;                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                 ..:INSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES:..               \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Double click on .ipa and then synchro your iphone with itunes.       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: IMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Start CORE10k.EXE to verify that this release comes really from    \n       CORE.
