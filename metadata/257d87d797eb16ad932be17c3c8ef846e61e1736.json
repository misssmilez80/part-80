A straight ahead, old school,\nplain and simple, power rock trio. The kind of band that has their first joining\nof instruments, plays the first few bars of whatever tune was mentioned, and has\nto stop playing immediately because that old cliched moment arises, when you\njust can't play anymore because everyone's grinning from ear to ear. It just\nfelt right.\n\nMashing together rock, blues, and old school gritty southern country rock,\nHudson has created a sound very unique yet very familiar at the same time. Their\nsound is much like many of their influences including, Foghat, Humble Pie, and\njust about anyone that has been playing anything close to rock and roll in the\nlast fifty years or so.\n\nHudson is quickly becoming the band to see. So come on out and join us, and help\nkeep the rock and roll spirit alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257d87d797eb16ad932be17c3c8ef846e61e1736","amp;dn":"Hudson-Hudson-2009-PMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257d87d797eb16ad932be17c3c8ef846e61e1736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,125,135,215,151,235,22,173,147,43,225,124,60,142,248,70,230,30,23,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
