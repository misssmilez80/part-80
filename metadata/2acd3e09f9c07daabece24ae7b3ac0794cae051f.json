When Katya finds out that Sachdev is attempting to rally the local residents against him, he has him brutally killed in broad daylight, and thus ended whatever opposition was there against Katya. Then Shambu Nath and his adopted son, Kashi Nath come to this community to visit his brother, Shiv Nath, as Shambu has to seek medical treatment, and is hospitalized.
