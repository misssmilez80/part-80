Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Roope Latvala (rhythm guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppala (bass), and Jaska Raatikainen (drums).\n\nThe band's third studio album, Follow the Reaper, was their first album to receive a Gold certification in Finland, and since then, all six of the band's studio albums have reached the same status. In Finland, Children of Bodom has released three consecutive albums that debuted at number one on Finnish album charts, and has also seen chart positions on the United States Billboard 200.\n\nThe band has incorporated many different musical styles, leading critics and fans to label them as melodic death metal, thrash metal, and power metal.\n\n\n1994 - Implosion Of Heaven (Demo) - MP3 224 Kb/s\n01.
