I believe that no other artist, save for Van Gogh or Michelangelo, and I do put her in that pantheon of genius, was able to transform suffering into great art through music, and create a distinguished legacy for all future generations to hear. \n\nWhen she cries &quot;Euridyce! Euridyce! Mortel silence, vaine ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©spÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rance!&quot; I am transported down into the underworld with OrphÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, searching for my lost lover and fighting off despair with every note. And so it is with every single cut on this CD set.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:579ab6f9fde46197405ed7281a90d8de560870d0","amp;dn":"Maria+Callas+-+At+Her+Best","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"579ab6f9fde46197405ed7281a90d8de560870d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,154,182,249,253,228,97,151,64,94,215,40,26,144,216,222,86,8,112,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
