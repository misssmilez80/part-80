After a triumphant Glastonbury appearance and a major illness, at 72, Dame Shirley Bassey, one of our greatest singers, tentatively re-enters the ring to confront her life in song.\n\nSome of the best contemporary songwriters, including Gary Barlow, the Pet Shop Boys, Manic Street Preachers, Rufus Wainwright, Richard Hawley and KT Tunstall, along with the famous Bond composer John Barry and lyricist Don Black, have interpreted her life through song for a new album produced by David Arnold. The songs frame and explore the myth of Shirley Bassey, the girl from Tiger Bay, and the voice and the desire are not found wanting! A back story profiling Shirley, complete with archive of her greatest performances, tells the story of what makes Dame Shirley Bassey the living legend that she is today. \n\n=====================================================================\n\nPaul O'Grady Show \nITV\n&quot;Apartment&quot;\n\n3mins\n\n=====================================================================\n\nShirley Bassey: Glastonbury (2007)\n\nFull live set:\nGet The Party Started\nLight My Fire\nGoldfinger/Moonraker/Diamonds Are Forever medley\nBig Spender\nThe Living Tree (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Tree)\nThe Lady is a Tramp\nIntermission\nMike Dixon Medley: Never Never Never/Kiss Me Honey Honey/ I Am What I Am\nFinalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\n\n\nWhen DSB breaks into Moonraker.
