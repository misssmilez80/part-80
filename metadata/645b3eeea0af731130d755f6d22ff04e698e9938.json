Fein was a top Justice Department official during the Reagan administration and has heavily criticized every president since. \n\nAlex also talks with television host Adam Kokesh, who was arrested with several other activists participating in a flash-mob at Jefferson Memorial for silently dancing in response to a ruling by a federal judge that the practice at the memorial does not show due reverence. \n\nAlex talks about a recent New Mexico Supreme Court decision allowing police in that state to violate the Second Amendment and confiscate firearms.\n\n\nToday's broadcast went 5 minutes into a 4th hour overDrive.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
