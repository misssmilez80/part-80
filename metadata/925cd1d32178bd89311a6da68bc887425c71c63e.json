A conversion to Christianity and subsequent softening of his music led to his having more of a pop than rock image. He never achieved the same impact in the United States despite several chart singles there, but he has remained a popular music, film, and television personality in the United Kingdom and he retains a following in other countries.\n\nDuring six decades, Cliff Richard has charted many singles, and holds the record (with Elvis Presley) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its decades (1950sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2000s). He is the only singer to have had a number one single in the UK in five consecutive decades, doing so from the 1950s through to the 1990s. On the British charts, Richard has had more than 130 singles, albums and EPs make the top 20, more than any other artist. He has sold more than 260 million records.\n\nIn 1979, Richard teamed up with the producer Bruce Welch for the pop hit single &quot;We Don't Talk Anymore&quot;, which hit #1 in the UK and #7 in the U.S. Brian Ferry added the backing vocals to the song, however, he only hummed the backing vocals, he didn't actually ever sing. The record gave Richard the distinction of becoming the first act to reach the Hot 100 in the 1980s who had also reached the Hot 100 in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single ever. The accompanying music video was the sixth to appear on American cable channel MTV when it dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©buted Aug. 1, 1981.\n\nAt long last he had some extended success in the United States following &quot;Devil Woman&quot;. The follow-up &quot;Dreaming&quot; also reached the top ten, peaking at #10. His 1980 duet &quot;Suddenly&quot; with Olivia Newton-John, from the film Xanadu, was a Top 20 hit in America, peaking at #20. Richard continued with a string of top ten albums, including I'm No Hero, Wired For Sound, Now You See Me, Now You Don't, and, marking his 25th year in show business, Silver. The singles chart also saw his most consistent period of top twenty hits since the mid 1960s, with three of them on the Hot 100 at the same time at the end of 1980. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925cd1d32178bd89311a6da68bc887425c71c63e","amp;dn":"Cliff+Richard+-+Dreaming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925cd1d32178bd89311a6da68bc887425c71c63e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,92,209,211,33,120,189,137,49,26,109,166,139,200,135,66,92,113,198,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
