Specifically crafted in response to the needs of Web authors and software developers, this award-winning product provides an abundance of high-performance features for editing, searching, and manipulation of text. An intelligent interface provides easy access to BBEditÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best-of-class features, including grep pattern matching, search and replace across multiple files, project definition tools, function navigation and syntax coloring for numerous source code languages, code folding, FTP and SFTP open and save, AppleScript, Mac OS X Unix scripting support, text and code completion, and of course a complete set of robust HTML tools.\nWith BBEdit, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n* Exercise Total Control Over Text\n\n* Work YOUR Way\n\n* Command Files, Folders, Disks, and Servers\n\n* Enjoy Textual Omnipotence\n\n* Live Up To Standards\n\n* Integrate Smoothly Into Existing Workflows\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new in BBEdit 9?\n\n* Projects ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Project is a vastly improved modern expression of\n   BBEditÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFile GroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feature. Project windows include an editing \n   view: Click on a file in the Project list, and it immediately appears in the\n   editing window. Projects may contain documents, folders, and \n   Collections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ custom groupings of documents that can be anywhere on\n   any local or remote computer.\n\n* Completion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BBEdit will figure out completions for your code or \n   text as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re editing, either after a delay in typing, or with a keystroke\n   (your choice). Completion can be turned on and off on a per-language \n   basis. They can be derived from a variety of sources, including (but not \n   limited to) Clippings, language-specific completions, and even the \n   system dictionary. When working in HTML/XHTML and CSS \n   , completion suggests appropriate tag and attribute names, as\n   well as providing easy completion of common CSS properties.\n\n* Edit in Results Windows and Disk Browsers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The text views in \n   browsing windows (disk browsers, search results, syntax-check \n   results, and similar) are now editable; rather than having to open a file\n   into a new window from such a browser, you can just edit it right there\n   in the windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lower pane.\n\n* Enhanced HTML/CSS support ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ HTML5 syntax checking is built\n    in, as well as syntax coloring improvements for other languages \n    embedded in  and  tags.\n\n* Modeless Find/Replace Windows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Multi-file search now has a \n    powerful window of its very own, and both the single- and multi-file\n    search windows are modeless, meaning you can work in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and copy\n    from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ open text documents without having to close the search \n    window. The search windowsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ interfaces have been greatly simplified, \n    without sacrificing any functionality. Also, BBEdit now preserves your \n    search-and-replace history even after you quit, and will remember it at \n    next launch.\n\n* Character-level Find Differences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Find Differences now uses the \n    system ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tool for generating the difference ranges displayed in the \n    application. The interface has also been improved, allowing you to see\n    more granular differences, not just differences by line. Sub-line \n    differences are visible by twisting the triangle twiddle for each line\n    difference result.\n\n* Scratchpad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The ScratchpadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s purpose is to be a space where you can\n    manipulate text by performing quick transforms, manual edits, or \n    batches of copy/paste. It is ideal for quickly beating text from one \n    source into submission before pasting it elsewhere. The Scratchpad  \n    window automatically saves its content and state, eliminating those\n    pesky ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave Untitled 237?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ warnings when closing a window or \n    quitting BBEdit.\n\n* Save/Copy as Styled Text ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Save as Styled Text saves your code as \n    an RTF file, with the same indentations and text coloring as you see in \n    your editor window. (The Copy variant copies the styled text to the \n    clipboard.) These features allow you to represent your documents easily\n    in other applications, or even show them to other humans. Or mammals. \n    Or even invertebrates, I guess.\n\n* Search Xcode Projects ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ An entry in the Find windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Source List \n   is now populated by XcodeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Recent Projects menu. Selecting one or\n   more Xcode projects will instruct the multi-file search to search each \n   text file in the selected Xcode project(s).\n\n* Fix/ToDo Tracking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Track your coding tasks easily: Ruby, C, Obj-C,\n    C++, and header files will now show commented FIXME and TODO\n    items in the function popup.\n \n* Improved Autosave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The application automatically saves its state \n   (open documents and windows) once per minute, so if something bad\n    happens to your machine, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pretty good chance that the next \n    time you start up, things will be as they were when the event occurred.\n\n* Tab-key functionality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The tab key can now be set to perform certain \n    actions (in addition to its existing important-but-mundane function of \n    indentation), including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgo to next placholder,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œindent text \n    blocks.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n* Preview in MS Windows browsers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ We now recognize application\n    stubs created by VMWare FusionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feature (available in \n    version 2.0 and later of VMware Fusion), so that you can preview\n    HTML documents in Windows versions of Firefox, Opera, \n    Safari, and Internet Explorer while theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re running in a Windows\n    virtual machine.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n* Mac OS X 10.5 or later (10.5.8, 10.6.7 or later recommended)\n* Universal application (for both Intel and PowerPC-based Macs)\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0621fa7858352ac98ffb7820ea784645464e1114","amp;dn":"BBedit+9.5+%2B+sn+-+re-runloaded+due+to+tracker+problems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0621fa7858352ac98ffb7820ea784645464e1114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,33,250,120,88,53,42,201,143,251,120,32,234,120,70,69,70,78,17,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
