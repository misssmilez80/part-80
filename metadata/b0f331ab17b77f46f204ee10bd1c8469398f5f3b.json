(Definitive Edition)\n\nThis is an expanded edition of Radio KAOS that was released years ago to the Echoes Pink Floyd mailing list. \nIt fleshes out the concept far better by including tracks that were used as b-sides and the When The Wind Blows soundtrack.\nIt also uses some clever reconstructing of &quot;Billy&quot; towards the end to recreate the dialog used in the KAOS vhs home video and concerts.\n\n1.  Get Back To Radio\n2.  Radio Waves (Extended)\n3.  Who Needs Information\n4.  Folded Flags\n5.  Me Or Him\n6.  Towers of Faith\n7.  The Powers That Be\n8.  Going To Live In L.A.\n9.  The Fish Report With A Beat\n10. Sunset Strip\n11. Home\n12. Four Minutes\n13. The Tide Is Turning (After Live Aid)\n14. Pipes And Drums\n\nI am unsure of the kpbs of the original, but it is ripped 256kpbs from my CD made from the original.\nMy notes show:\nRemixed and Resequenced 2000 Project KAOS\nby Chad Hendrickson.\nThank you Chad wherever you are!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f331ab17b77f46f204ee10bd1c8469398f5f3b","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+Radio+KAOS+%28Expanded+PROJECT+KAOS+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f331ab17b77f46f204ee10bd1c8469398f5f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,243,49,171,23,183,127,70,242,4,238,16,189,28,132,105,57,143,95,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
