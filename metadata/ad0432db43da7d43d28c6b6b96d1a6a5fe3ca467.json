It is one of the most-used alternatives to Nero Burning ROM on Windows, but not as popular as the latter.\n \nIts main advantages are that it is simple, lightweight, and very easy to use.\n\n However, that is also one of its weaknesses: it does not contain many extras that power users might find useful.\n \nIt is capable of creating compilations of CDs, Optical Disc Images, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs.\n \nIt also allows the creation of DVD movies from video files.\n \nAs a way to promote their brand and software, Ashampoo has released Ashampoo Burning Studio 6 as free software.\n \nAshampoo Burning Studio 2010 Advanced is a stripped down free version of Ashampoo Burning Studio 9.24 which is available through third party websites.\n\n\n\n\nenjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE APPS 2011 *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad0432db43da7d43d28c6b6b96d1a6a5fe3ca467","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Burning+Studio+10+portable+-+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad0432db43da7d43d28c6b6b96d1a6a5fe3ca467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,4,50,219,67,218,125,67,210,140,107,107,150,209,166,165,254,60,164,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
