As a result their marriage hits an impasse and Joseph decides to overcome this rift through a challenging journey which takes him beyond all that he holds to be true to a higher spiritual realm of unconditional love.\n\nProduction Status: \tReleased\nGenres: \tDrama and Romance\nRunning Time: \t1 hr. 43 min.\nMPAA Rating: \tR\nDistributors: \t\nTriumph Releasing\nProduction Co.: \t\nStewart Pictures, Triumph Pictures\nU.S. Box Office: \t$207,751\nFilming Locations: \t\nVancouver, British Columbia, Canada\nProduced in: \tUnited States\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nMany couples would do well to watch this movie. While it contains some sex, it is not a porn movie but one about deeply mental and spiritual issues in close relationships with a strong message to many couples out there. \n\nIt took me over 2 weeks to download the entire DVD at 5-7 kB/s. Most torrents I found were dead. I'm dedicating some serious bandwidth to this now and I'll likely upload a smaller AVI version of this, too. Please download and seed - this movie is worth spreading. Could save many marriages.\n\nUpdate: There's now a 850 MB .avi (xvid) file available here (English subs): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5181183&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5181183&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUpdate: Something is wrong with a few smaller files in this torrent and I seem unable to fix it.
