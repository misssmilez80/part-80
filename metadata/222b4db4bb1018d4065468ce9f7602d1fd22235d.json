Fisher and his stars--Celia Johnson, Margaret Leighton, and Coward himself--vividly convey the playwright's brittle, sophisticated view of the world. Coward stars as Christian Faber, a psychiatrist who falls in love with the much-younger Leonora Vail (Leighton). This means that Faber must convince himself that his blissful 10-year marriage to wife Barbara (Johnson) is truly at an end. Once he's made this compromise with his conscience, Faber further deteriorates into petulant jealousy when Leonora begins roaming. The surprise ending is all the more surprising because the audience is pulling for Faber (despite his emotional immaturity) and is hoping that he'll pull himself out of his self-imposed mess. In addition to writing and starring in The Astonished Heart, Noel Coward also composed the musical score. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041134/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041134/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirectors:\nAntony Darnborough\nTerence Fisher\n\n\nCelia Johnson\t ... \tBarbara Faber\n\tNoel Coward\t... \tDr. Christian Faber\n\tMargaret Leighton\t... \tLeonora Vail\n\tJoyce Carey\t... \tSusan Birch\n\tGraham Payn\t... \tTim Verney\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:24:59\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 544x400  Ratio  1.36:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1027 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,19 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:222b4db4bb1018d4065468ce9f7602d1fd22235d","amp;dn":"The+Astonished+Heart+%281950%29+Celia+Johnson+%28Eng%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"222b4db4bb1018d4065468ce9f7602d1fd22235d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,43,77,180,187,16,24,212,6,84,104,206,159,118,2,209,253,34,35,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
