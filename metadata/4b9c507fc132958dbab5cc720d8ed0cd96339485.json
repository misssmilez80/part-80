Step Inside Love/Los Paranoias/The Way You Look \nTonight/Can You Take Me Back? (Paul, John &amp; Ringo studio outtake)\n10. Step Inside Love (Paul Home Demo)\n\nJust got this from My Man In Amsterdam last week. Much previously heard material here. Most of it already available on Purple Chick's &quot;White Album Deluxe.&quot; Of interest primarily because of Track 2-- this is the first time that this cut has seen release at the proper speed-- the original release was 5% slow. Track 9 *might* be a bit longer than previous releases of this track, Track 10 has such poor sound I wouldn't want to guess if it's been heard before, or in better condition, it's very hard to tell.\n\nThis disc *is* interesting, in that it tracks the evolution of the song &quot;Revolution&quot; through its various incarnations, the slow (LP) and fast (45 rpm) versions of the song, the much-discussed 2nd Remix of Revolution \nTake 20, and an alternate unused mix of Revolution 9 with unused overdubs, and allows the listener a chance to compare them side-by-side. And it settles a point of controversy: You can hear a bit more of the Take 20 RM2 \noverdubs on the Revolution 9 track here than you can on the released versions (Mono &amp; Stereo), pretty much cementing the authenticity of RM2 as a genuine track, instead of an &quot;outfake&quot; as a few well-respected critics claimed after its initial release. \n\nCheers,\n\nWalter Five\n13th Floor Elevator\nEnron Hubbard Bldg.\nHouston, Texxas\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9c507fc132958dbab5cc720d8ed0cd96339485","amp;dn":"Beatles+Mad+Day+OUt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9c507fc132958dbab5cc720d8ed0cd96339485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,156,80,127,193,50,149,141,186,181,204,114,13,142,208,205,150,51,148,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
