If you choose to install, do so at your own risk and only if you're comfortable in the process of upgrading and downgrading your device software. It is quite normal during operating system development for certain features to be crippled or disabled while others are tested, and these beta builds often reflect that. They are not always better. Depending on your BlackBerry comfort level, it may be best for you to wait for community feedback on a build before deciding to download and install for yourself or simply wait for the next official release. If you require support, you will find it in our CrackBerry forums via our extremely knowledgeable community base - do not contact your carrier or RIM for Beta OS technical support (their first course of action will be to advise you to downgrade to a supported OS). \n\nPackage Version: 5.0.0.489\nConsisting of:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Applications: 5.0.0.314\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Software Platform: 5.2.0.20\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢File name: 8900M_PBr5.0.0_rel489_PL5.2.0.20_A5.0.0.314\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢File size: 147 MB\n\nInstructions to install on ANY 8900 from ANY CARRIER.\n\n1.
