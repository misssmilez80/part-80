Much of the material is produced by the band and Steve Osborne, and isn't nearly as dense as Curve's debut, which benefited from their work with Flood. The non-focus tracks of the EPs are every bit the equal of the songs that eventually found their way onto DoppelgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nger, with many of them being true gems. &quot;No Escape from Heaven&quot; features a sultry vocal performance by Toni Halliday over a galloping percussive beat and drive-by bursts of guitar. And &quot;Cherry&quot; is the high point of this collection. The song starts out quietly with hushed vocals and subtle keyboards before the drums signal a blast of fuzz guitars and everything crashes into a riveting sound collage. \n\n01 Ten Little Girls (4:27)\n02 I Speak Your Every Word (3:55)\n03 Blindfold (4:32)\n04 No Escape from Heaven (4:21)\n05 Coast Is Clear (4:01)\n06 The Colour Hurts (4:35)\n07 Frozen (3:59)\n08 Zoo (3:51)\n09 Clipped (4:14)\n10 Die Like a Dog (4:41)\n11 Galaxy (3:57)\n12 Cherry (5:50)\n13 FaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®t Accompli [Extended Version] (6:24)\n\n-----\n\nFrom Cuckoo's Nest, The Curve Archive:\n\nCURVE. &quot;PUBIC FRUIT&quot;\n\n&quot;This is not a new CURVE album, this is PUBIC FRUIT, a compilation of the first three British ep's plus the extended\nversion of FAÃƒÆ’Ã…Â½T ACCOMPLI. The running order is the same as the original records, and FAÃƒÆ’Ã…Â½T ACCOMPLI was added\nbecause it was never available in the US commercially, also because we love it and thought you might too.&quot;\n\nall songs written by Halliday / Garcia. published by Virgin Songs Inc. / Sony Music Publishing UK / Anxious Music ltd.\nAll rights o/b/o Sony Music Publishing UK / Anxious Music adminstered in the United States by Sony Songs Inc.
