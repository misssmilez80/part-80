The blockbuster debut feature from Lust, Caution assistant director Roy Chow, Murderer throws all reservations to the wind for an unpredictable, nerve-wrecking suspense thriller that may be bound for camp cult classic status. Co-starring Taiwan beauty Ning Chang (Silk), Johnnie To regular Eddie Cheung, Josie Ho, Shaw Brothers veteran Chen Kuan Tai, and child actor Tam Chun Yat, the film weaves blood and brutality into a psychodrama murder mystery with a shocking twist and an over-the-top final act. Love it or hate it, you're not likely to forget Murderer. There's a brutal serial killer on the loose, and the latest victim is cop Tai (Chen Kuan Tai), who lies comatose in the hospital after getting thrown off a building. Also at the scene of the crime was fellow detective Ling (Aaron Kwok), who wakes up with no injuries and no memory of the incident. Rumors spread quickly in the police force as Ling turns into the prime suspect. Convinced that someone's out to get him and his family, Ling searches desperately for the murderer, but all the clues he encounters point back to himself.\n\ntrailer :  you tube\n\nofficial :  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.murdererthemovie.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.murdererthemovie.net/&lt;/a&gt;    \n\nAudio :         Chinese Cantonese  Dolby Digital EX 5.1 - 384 Kbps\n\n Subs :   English, Chinese\n\n   121 min\n       NTSC\n      1.78 : 1\n\nr.i.p. mininova","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422900252c629352b513869189af53835cbbb1ba","amp;dn":"Murderer+%282009%29+DVDR+%28Boz%29-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422900252c629352b513869189af53835cbbb1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,41,0,37,44,98,147,82,181,19,134,145,137,175,83,131,92,187,177,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
