Primarily through the multifaceted activities of Jerusalem-based Yeshivat Aish HaTorah, Rabbi Weinberg influenced tens of thousands of college-aged youth to learn more about their Jewish heritage and embrace lives of Torah and mitzvah observance. He also reached out to business executives, professionals and Hollywood celebrities with private and group learning opportunities. Many of the programs which he and his staff developed became successful spin-offs in their own right, such as the Discovery Seminar, Jerusalem Fellowships, HonestReporting, and the highly-trafficked Jewish educational website, Aish.com.\n\nHis upbeat, charismatic personality and message of gaining happiness through acquiring Torah wisdom and experiencing the pleasure of a relationship with God were well-known to listeners of his widely-circulated tape series, especially &quot;The 48 Ways to Wisdom&quot;. He also co-authored a book, What the Angel Taught You: Seven keys to life fulfillment, published by ArtScroll.\n\n---\n\nMore information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.simpletoremember.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.simpletoremember.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kiruv.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kiruv.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n...............................\n\nfor all\n\n...............................\n\nWake up King !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33f4d62709e42bd69e9344aa41aa0474bf8cde45","amp;dn":"48+Ways+to+Wisdom+by+Rabbi+Noah+Weinberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33f4d62709e42bd69e9344aa41aa0474bf8cde45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,244,214,39,9,228,43,214,158,147,68,170,65,170,4,116,191,140,222,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
