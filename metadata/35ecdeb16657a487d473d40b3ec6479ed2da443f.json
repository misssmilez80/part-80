Alas, I confess a certain disappointment regarding Carole's follow ups to Tapestry.  &quot;Music&quot; was just ok; &quot;Rhymes and Reasons&quot; left me flat, and &quot;Fantasy&quot; seemed to be an odd misfire.  By the time September 1974 rolled around and &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot; was released, I had low expectations. . . then, boom! I heard the first single, &quot;Jazzman,&quot; and rejoiced.  The album soon followed, and I immediately fell in love with it! Vocally, Carole has never been better (except on her latest, &quot;Love Makes the World&quot;), and the tunes are diverse, catchy, melodic, and absolutely wonderful.  I especially love &quot;My Lovin' Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Best is Yet to Come,&quot; with &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot; and &quot;You Gentle Me&quot; falling close behind.  I still have my original LP from 1974 and just added the CD - it's fun to alternate between the two! Incidentally, this was the last of Carole's albums to hit #1 on the Billboard charts - check it out! You won't be disappointed.  Great music always ages well, and that's exactly what you'll find on &quot;Wrap Around Joy!&quot; ~ Rod Labbe\n\nCarole King - Wrap Around Joy Tracks:\n01  Nightingale\n02  Change In Mind, Change Of Heart\n03  Jazzman\n04  You Go Your Way, I'll Go Mine\n05  You're Something New\n06  We Are All In This Together\n07  Wrap Around Joy\n08  You Gentle Me\n09  My Lovin' Eyes\n10  Sweet Adonis\n11  A Night This Side Of Dying\n12  The Best Is Yet To Come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35ecdeb16657a487d473d40b3ec6479ed2da443f","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Wrap+Around+Joy+%281974%29+%5BRock+Pop%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35ecdeb16657a487d473d40b3ec6479ed2da443f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,236,222,177,102,87,164,135,212,115,212,11,62,198,71,158,210,218,68,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
