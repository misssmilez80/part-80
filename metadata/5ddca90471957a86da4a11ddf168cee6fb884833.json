Includes &quot;Pages&quot; and &quot;Keynote&quot;.  It's compatible with both Panther and Tiger, haven't tried it with Leopard, but it should work.\n\niWork contains two great applications for creating stunning, media-rich documents and presentations with ease. iWork includes Pages, a powerful word-processing application, and Keynote version 2.0, a flexible application for producing presentations, interactive slideshows, and more. iWork gives you the tools to express yourself with style.  \n\nNote: Just started using Transmission as my torrent client and I really like it - much quicker than BitTorrent (sorry) and easy to understand.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddca90471957a86da4a11ddf168cee6fb884833","amp;dn":"Iwork+%5C%2705.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddca90471957a86da4a11ddf168cee6fb884833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,220,169,4,113,149,122,134,218,74,17,221,241,104,206,230,251,136,72,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
