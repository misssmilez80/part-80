But by whom? What really\n      happened? In The Unofficial Story, the fifth estates Bob McKeown\n      introduces us to people who believe the real force behind the attacks\n      was not Osama Bin Laden, but the U.S. government itself.\n\n      Emerging from the dust and debris that day was a movement, known these\n      days as 9/11 Truth or truthers  people who believe that 9/11 was part\n      of a vast conspiracy and cover-up by a criminal faction within the U.S.\n      government. As the fifth estate reports, public opinion polls now show\n      that the majority of Americans believe the Bush Administration had\n      advance knowledge of those attacks and somehow allowed them to happen\n      and that one-third of Canadians share the same belief.\n\n      In The Unofficial Story, Bob McKeown explores why these questions and\n      theories are growing in popularity.\n\n      Youll meet some of the leading proponents of truther theories: Richard\n      Gage, an American architect, explains how the WTC twin towers and the\n      lesser known Tower #7 could only have crumbled as they did due to\n      explosive charges placed inside the buildings. Others, including Canadian\n      professor Kee Dewdney, insist that the story of the brave fight by the\n      passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 must have been a hoax. But, youll\n      also hear from others who dispel truther theories and try to understand\n      why, from JFKs assassination to the moon landing to 9/11, a culture of\n      conspiracy springs up around certain historic events.\n\n      Despite the difference of opinion between those who blame the hijackers\n      and those who blame their own government, the real importance of the\n      fight over 9/11 truth is that it may have less to do with the past than\n      the future.\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                    Yours truly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f8cfbac7cac9cc643edf44683720b23bc57bab","amp;dn":"The.Fifth.Estate-The_Unofficial_Story.2009.HDTV.XviD-YT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f8cfbac7cac9cc643edf44683720b23bc57bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,248,207,186,199,202,201,204,100,62,223,68,104,55,32,178,59,197,123,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
