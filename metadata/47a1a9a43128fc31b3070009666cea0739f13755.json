In Chemistry of Tantalum and Niobium Fluoride Compounds, the author draws on thirty years' experience to produce the first ever monograph to systemize and summarize the data available on tantalum and niobium fluoride compounds. This comprehensive reference source offers a rich variety of study methodology and is invaluable to researchers examining the chemistry of fluorides, as well as teachers and students in chemistry and metallurgy.\n\n* Collects the latest research on the chemistry of complex fluorides and oxyfluorides of Tantalum and Niobium.\n* Covers both theory and application of Tantalum and Niobium Fluoride Chemistry\n* Is suitable for tantalum and niobium producers, researchers studying the chemistry of fluorides, as well as teachers and students in chemistry and metallurgy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a1a9a43128fc31b3070009666cea0739f13755","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Chemistry+of+Tantalum+and+Niobium+Fluoride+Compound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a1a9a43128fc31b3070009666cea0739f13755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,161,169,164,49,40,252,49,179,7,0,9,102,108,234,7,57,241,55,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
