You will be able to edit any character in your party.\n\nGive items, change amount of items and even your money. Get all GF's, all cards. Have best weapons, get all the magic spells (even some you can't draw/use normally such as Apocalypse, Percent, Rapture.. and of course; The End.)\n\nAll in all, if you played FF8 a few times around, like me.. you may wanna have a bit of fun doing stuff you couldn't usually do very early in the game. \n\nI don't really use this tool much myself, but its handy if you feel like messing around.\n\nAnyway.. without further a-do. Download the torrent and have fun with it.. post comments or questions if you like.\n\nAlso be sure to get my Download version of FF8. Click my name for the torrent location! Zero errors/crashes.. perfect working FF8 DVD copy.\n\nUploaded by KillerHaze\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf4a4e7bc29a36cde820f6639e5cea81ed948a8","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VIII+Editor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf4a4e7bc29a36cde820f6639e5cea81ed948a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,244,164,231,188,41,163,108,222,130,15,102,57,229,206,168,30,217,72,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
