Only a few people are aware of their existence; their mother who goes batty soon after giving birth, their uncle, Narinton, who is after their wealth, which is ultimately their inheritance, and one of the twinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foster mother, Wantha. Since neither of these people are in any condition, be it voluntary or involuntary, to bring forth this information, the twins grow up apart and live completely different lives. Kaew is raised by Wantha and although  she saved Kaew from death, she treats her like a slave and constantly abuses her right as her savior. Kaew meets Meuang Man (Captain) who provides her small glimpses of happiness amidst her arduous and bleak life. Meanwhile, Chit Chanok grows up in France with their father, Wooraman, and lives a humble, yet, privileged life. Wooraman lies to Chit Chanok about her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s existence because he surmises that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be better off thinking her mother is dead rather than knowing that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alive but mental. However, one day Chit Chanok finds out the truth and returns to Thailand, determined to find her mother. This is no easy feat since Narinton is bent on getting rid of any heirs to Koom Wiang Fah, the estate in Thailand. What does fate have in stored for Kaew and Chit Chanok? Will they get to live together as a complete family? Will Kaew be able to free herself of the mentality that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s undeserving of love?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a8a3a00607f7eeb38182c3affe132db74aa96d","amp;dn":"Kaew+Leum+Kon+TV5+Series+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a8a3a00607f7eeb38182c3affe132db74aa96d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,168,163,160,6,7,247,238,179,129,130,195,175,254,19,45,183,74,169,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
