The only thing that seems to be missing from Laura (Shue)'s otherwise perfect life is a child, and when Laura and her husband discover that she has become pregnant it seems that all the pair's dreams are finally coming true. Motherhood is far from the simple and instinctual task that Laura imagined it would be, however, and soon after the birth of her child the confused new parent finds herself struggling with the pains of post-partum depression. Despite her determination to protect her baby at all costs, Laura begins to question her abilities as a parent after moving into a large and isolated new home. Now, as a plague of rats flood into the basement of the home, a mysterious diary is pulled from inside the decrepit walls of the home, and a new nanny is hired to help the distressed mother care for her newborn child, the situation soon descends into a harrowing battle for sanity as the fate of a young child hangs in the balance. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 120 mins \nComplete Cast:\nElisabeth Shue - Laura\nKathleen Chalfant\nKhandi Alexander\nSteven Mackintosh\nBlair Brown\n\n\nDirector(s):Isaac Webb\nWriter(s):Isaac Webb\nProducer(s):Lemore Syvan, Rick Schwartz\nCategories:Mystery &amp; Suspense\n\nFormat: DVD\nRelease Date: 03/20/2007\nMPAA Rating: PG13\nRunning Time: 120 min\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLanguage: Eng\nSubTitles: Spa\nView special edition features\nView special edition features\nLimited Edition Features:\nEnglish 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound\nSpanish subtitles\nEnglish CC\nPreviews\n\nBlockbuster info link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blockbuster.com/browse/catalog/movieDetails/319431&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blockbuster.com/browse/catalog/movieDetails/319431&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\n\nThis is an EvilTSAngel Oroginal DVDRip!\n\nOriginal Menu's and Extra's included!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d10082c8a4005a66e99b2bfb47875e630ef4a51","amp;dn":"First+Born+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d10082c8a4005a66e99b2bfb47875e630ef4a51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,16,8,44,138,64,5,166,110,153,178,191,180,120,117,230,48,239,74,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
