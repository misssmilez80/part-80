Three stories of &quot;love in the country&quot;: a pseudo Don Giovanni confesses his impotence to the doctor in confidence but he becomes betrayed by him - the medic speaks about his patient with some befriend gossips; a bank employee, after a tormented affair with the young waitress of a bar, returns to be single - disappointed and made bitter; some boys exploit the gratitude of an ingenuous girl from the vicinity.
