Returning home after army service in World War II, he worked for a soyabean oil company, but continued to make music occasionally at weekends, yet his raw approach to the blues betrayed a style rooted in the country. In 1961 folklorist Sam Charters was in Memphis looking for someone who could sing 'those real, old, hard blues' when Will Shade introduced him to Willie Borum. This album, the first of Willie B's two for Prestige/Bluesville labels, reveals in Charters's words, 'an intense, moving singer in the greatest blues tradition'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87eb6de2e9fe52c624b1871f48d87639b0443536","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Introducing+Memphis+Willie+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87eb6de2e9fe52c624b1871f48d87639b0443536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,235,109,226,233,254,82,198,36,177,135,31,72,216,118,57,176,68,53,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
