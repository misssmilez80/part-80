Disc 3 has a couple of very interesting and worth-while documentaries, &quot;Making Waves&quot; which is about the making of The Blue Planet, and &quot;Deep Trouble&quot; which shows and warns of the consequences of plundering our oceans for food and the fish that are caught for pet shops. Disc 4 has 3 separate documentary programmes that are not really connected with David Attenborough's Blue Planet series. They are &quot;The Abyss&quot; that takes us down for a look at the deep sea creatures and geology (including volcanic activity) of the deepest parts of the Atlantic, Caribbean and the Bay of Monterey, &quot;Amazon Abyss&quot; that takes us to meet some of the extraordinary creatures that live in the deeps (and shallows) of the River Amazon, and &quot;Dive to Shark Volcano&quot; where we can admire the sharks around Cocos Island, 300 miles from Costa Rica.\n\nThe 8 amazing, 50 minute episodes of Blue Planet are: 1) &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; which gives a comprehensive overview of our oceans; 2) &quot;The Deep&quot; that pushes the boundaries, showing creatures that have never been seen before, deep in the least known parts of our planet; 3) &quot;The Open Ocean&quot; takes us to parts of the ocean where signs of life are scarce - unless you know where to look; 4) &quot;Frozen Seas&quot; looks at life in the hostile environments of the Arctic and Antarctic; 5) &quot;Seasonal Seas&quot; follows the seasons of the seas round the planet's temperate zones; 6) &quot;Coral Seas&quot; shows us ocean life in the tropical paradise regions; 7) &quot;Tidal Seas&quot; follows the fortunes of the plants and animals where the Moon's pull is great; 8) &quot;Coasts&quot; features the permanent residents of the coasts and those who have to return to the shore to breed.\n\nThe first 3 discs are the real stars of this package. I can't think of any documentary series that comes close to the scope and quality of this - except other David Attenborough series (where in every case the programmes are bound to be watched over and over again). Where this particular series is slightly ahead of the other Attenborough wonders, is the technical advance in the photography since, for example, &quot;Life on Earth&quot;. You only need to compare the documentaries on disc 4 of this bundle (where the photography is brilliant but the presentation could leave you wondering whether the programmes are about the wildlife or are they really about the personalities of the programme presenters and their whiz-bang technology) to &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; series on discs 1 and 2, to be appreciate what a superior production Blue Planet really is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2d19fa7082d2d3b49d83c025f9cba1b85ca31d","amp;dn":"BLUE+PLANET-SPECIAL+EDITION+BOXSET+DISC+2+OFF+4+IN+H.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2d19fa7082d2d3b49d83c025f9cba1b85ca31d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,45,25,250,112,130,210,211,180,157,131,192,37,249,203,161,184,92,163,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
