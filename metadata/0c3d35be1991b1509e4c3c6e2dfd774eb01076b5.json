In this star-studded program, Mr. WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s message is simple and effective: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dance!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ His sound goes back to the roots of house music; the ideal kick-off for this first ever Serbian edition of Sensation.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Fedde le Grand\nFrom the moment Fedde le Grand acquired world fame with the ubiquitous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Put Your Hands Up for DetroitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in 2006, he has established himself as a solid house dj. With a winning streak of chart busting productions and remixes and of course his mesmerizing dj-skills, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see why Le Grand is a worldwide favorite. \n\nChuckie\nFusing hip hop with house, Chuckie has become widely acclaimed for his signature Dirty Dutch sound. In the last decade he has built his name as one of the most gifted and technically sound jocks of The Netherlands. His skills havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t gone unnoticed abroad. From U.S.A. to Japan, from Europe to South AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chuckie is leaving a trace of believers wherever he plays.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n\nSebastian Ingrosso\nSebastian Ingrosso stormed into the DJ Mag Top 100 in 2009, and he hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t left since. Many around the globe have embraced the compelling sounds of this Swedish House Mobster: ecstatic electro house best played in big rooms and arenaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Belgrade can rest assured Sebastian will take the dancefloor on a spellbinding musical rollercoaster-ride.\n\nSander van Doorn\nPushing the envelope for the big room sound, Sander van Doorn has become one of HollandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most renowned export-djÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Steadily in the highest ranks of the Top 100 World DJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, he remains a musical force to be reckoned with. Already he has remixed legendary bands like Depeche Mode and The Killers.
