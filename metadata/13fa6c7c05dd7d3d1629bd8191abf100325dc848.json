Meat Loaf live in St. Petersburg, Florida was recorded from the audience on August 23rd, 1989. The picture and audio quality aren't great. In fact we get to see a whole lot of black screens during the concert as the taper was in the middle of the crowd trying to fil over and past the other fans. The sound is low and has a hiss. The show itself however is very entertaining.\n\nFor more info on Meat Loaf visit my website \n\nwww.meatloafexperience.com\n\nRunning Time: 91 minutes\nPAL DVD\nChapters: yes for each song\nCover: Created and Included\n\nSet List:\n01 Out of the Frying Pan\n02 Masculine\n03 You Took the Words\n04 Dead Ringer\n05 Midnight at the Lost and Found\n06 All Revved Up\n07 Talk with the Audience\n08 Heaven Can Wait\n09 Bat Out of hell\n10 Two Out of Three (incomplete)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13fa6c7c05dd7d3d1629bd8191abf100325dc848","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+live+in+St+Petersburg+1989+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13fa6c7c05dd7d3d1629bd8191abf100325dc848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,250,108,124,5,221,125,61,22,41,189,129,145,171,241,0,50,93,200,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
