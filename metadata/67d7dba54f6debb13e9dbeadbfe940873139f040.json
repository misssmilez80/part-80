In Flash CS4 Professional: Building UI Elements, Todd Perkins demonstrates how these two programming tools work together to build common UI widgets, such as scrollbars, preloaders, sliders, and checkboxes.

Step by step, he builds one widget per chapter, covering the skills it takes to develop a fully functioning application.\n\nExercise Files are Included\n\n1. Extract .7z file with 7-zip\n\n2.
