Since Curve's fan base hasn't exactly gone through a drastic shift between 1991 and 2002, it's generally happy with the duo sticking to the same sound, which has shown very subtle variations from release to release. Since the duo's first single, several groups have attempted to mimic that sound or use that formula ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dark dance beats, blurs of grinding guitars, a vulnerable but deadly vocal command ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to no good effect. (Pick an action film or teensploitation soundtrack from the last several years at random, and odds are you'll find at least one short-lived, stale-sounding Curve clone.) Or, in Garbage's case, that template has been shrewdly polished and taken to the mainstream to very good effect. Throughout all of this, Curve has retained a very specific sound, and their enduring relevance has also had a good deal to do with the production, which has given their records an up-to-date or ahead-of-the-times feel. Curve has the small market they occupy cornered. So here's another web-only exclusive from the group that neither stands up to their best work nor dilutes it. Roughly half of these songs would make a suitable backdrop for a scene in a Gregg Araki film, in which the bodies of two malnourished androgynymphs feverishly tangle. These roaring numbers, as always, are tempered with slower, quieter material. The biggest (possibly only) surprise is what's stuck at the end of this disc: a strange little rave-up sung by multi-instrumentalist Dean Garcia. Despite the fact that their records no longer sound completely unique, Garcia and Toni Halliday continue to please their loyal fan base while the popularity they deserve eludes them. At this point, they really couldn't care. Why should they? \n\n01 Answers (5:28)\n02 Till the Cows Come Home (6:55)\n03 Every Good Girl (7:38)\n04 Cold Comfort [Deepsky Remix] (6:25)\n05 Star (6:46)\n06 Nice and Easy (3:27)\n07 Signals and Alibis (7:12)\n08 Sinner (5:11)\n09 Joy (4:27)\n\n-----\n\nCURVE. &quot;THE NEW ADVENTURES OF CURVE&quot;\n\nProduced Engineered and Recorded by Curve\nRecorded and Mixed at Todal 2002\nAll songs written by Halliday / Garcia\n\nToni Halliday Vocals Lyrics\nDean Garcia Bass Drums Guitars Vocals Programming\nAlan Moulder Additional Guitars and FX Tracks 2 5 7\n\nRecorded using Mac Pro Tools between Jan / May 2002\nMixed by Alan Moulder\nStar mixed by Alan Moulder and Rob Kirwan\nAnswers Nice and Easy and Joy mixed by Dean Garcia\nMastered by Paul Davies at the Townhouse\nSleeve Design and Photography www.flatearth.co.uk\nPress Phill Savidge www.savageandsavidge.com\n\nAll songs published by CURVE copyright control\n\n&quot;Thanks to all those good good people&quot;\nA   F A T L I P   2 0 0 2   recording\n\nUK release (June 2002)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995212a6ab62a69f3b666c35f69a801090f7d5a9","amp;dn":"Curve+-+The+New+Adventures+of+Curve+%282002%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995212a6ab62a69f3b666c35f69a801090f7d5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,82,18,166,171,98,166,159,59,102,108,53,246,154,128,16,144,247,213,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
