You must install this if you are using appletv and the output file is over 2gb.  You will get a fatal AtomicParsley error otherwise when it tries to tag the file.\n\nJust a note, if you use the -I option with -t appletv you may experience framerate slow down in certain scenes (with Apple TV playback).\n\n-----------\n\nNew in 5.1b\n\nAdded support for Apple TV Cabac/trellis mode with option -I\n\nApparently this works and Apple TV published specs are wrong for some reason.\n\n-----------\n\nNew in 5.1a\n\nLogic error surrounding new ffmpeg -codecs that was introduced in 5.0c\nMost likely wouldn't effect anyone.
