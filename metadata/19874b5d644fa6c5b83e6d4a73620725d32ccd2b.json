IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m always comfortable working with him. It feels natural. It will be a magical moment and it will feel like IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m back in the saddle. Hopefully Barry will feel the same way.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Strictly has taken on a life of its own in this country, and rightly so. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not an expert on the dancing, but I am a fan and I hope everyone enjoys watching us as well.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nTheir comeback was, however, tinged with sadness, because it was the first time they had performed without their brother Maurice.\n\nHe was RobinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s twin and died in 2003, aged just 53, from complications following an operation to correct an intestinal blockage.\n\nThe surviving brothers were so grief-stricken that the Bee Gees temporarily disbanded. It has taken them until now to process both their personal pain and the effect it has had on their professional endeavours.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Losing Maurice was an emotional tragedy for both of us,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Robin added before the Strictly performance. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“It was so sudden, and he hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been ill beforehand. He was too young to die.\n\n'It was awfully sad for us and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still hard to believe. Barry and I had our different ways of dealing with it. Barry couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t face being a Bee Gee or making music. I respected that. It took a few years for us to break through that emotion.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a day that goes by that we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think of Maurice. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still sometimes hard to believe it has happened but it has brought Barry and me closer as brothers.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“We realised we had to enjoy what we had, and the good news is weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re through the emotional breakwater now.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nSo much so that last month, Barry, 63, and Robin, 59, announced that they were reuniting to honour MauriceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memory and mark 50 years of making music together.\n\nDuring that time they have sold more than 200million records and become prolific songwriters for some of the industryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest artists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach Boys CD: Track Listing\n\n   1.
