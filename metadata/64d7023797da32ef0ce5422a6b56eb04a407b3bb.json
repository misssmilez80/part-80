These 3 films are in my top 10 of all time Motion Pictures.\n\n\nI have been uploading torrent Files for about 6 years now. The All Time biggest download I Have had is Jesus of Nazareth from the 1970\\'s. Millions have watched this Premiere production that I keep uploading over and over and every time there are bigger amounts of downloads. Jesus keeps getting bigger and bigger.\n\nHere is a recommendation. Watch the First 3 Parts of Jesus of Nazareth, then replace Part 4 with Mel Gibson\\'s Passion of The Christ. Back in The 70\\'s you could not show the Violence that was imposed on The Body of Jesus Christ. Mel even went a little \\&quot;Light\\&quot; on The Violence of The Crucifixion of Jesus. There are now 8 other Jesus Movies besides the 2 already spoken of.\n\nJesus King of All Kings\nJesus of Nazareth\nKing of Kings\nThe Gospel of John\nThe Greatest Story Ever Told\nThe Jesus Film Project\nThe Miracle Maker\nThe Passion of The Christ\nJesus The Movie\n\nThe Star of Bethlehem - This can be downloaded by it\\'s self with Starry Night Software at \n\n\n\n\nPOtHS - The Star of Bethlehem - New Software (Included) Confirms Biblical Birth of Jesus thru The Bible, Astronomy and Astrology.\n\nFrom Stephen McEveety, Producer of Passion Of The Christ\n\nWow,Wow and WOW. What a Christmas Gift. I have watched this presentation 10 times in the last 2 days. Magnificent this is. This MOVIE will move all that watch. Believers and non-believers alike are in AWH at this presentation. You should watch this Christmas Day and see what the Stars say about December 25. It is not what you think. The Lunar eclipse as we witnessed Monday NIGHT in California is a True sign of The Maker Yahweh. In 2014 and 2015 4 of these Prophesied Blood Moon happenings ALL occur on Jewish Feast Holidays. If that not a Prophetic sign, NOTHING IS. The New software included lets you look at the Same Sky that Jesus looked at 2000 years ago. This is Spectacular.\n\nYou can see the same skies the Jews gazed at thousands of years ago when the Star of Bethlehem appeared in the Skies to Mark the Birth of Jesus of Nazareth.[/size]\n\n\ntype POtHS in your search window for more info, or just Google POtHS\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                     Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                          End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                                     Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&lt;/a&gt;                                                                               Current Bible Prophecy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                              Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                        Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                     Chuck Missler - USA &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&lt;/a&gt;                                    Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
