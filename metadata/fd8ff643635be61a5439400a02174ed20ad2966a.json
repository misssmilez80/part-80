C. Verma\n\nExcellent books exist on physics at an introductory college level so why a new one? Why so many books exist at the same level, in the first place, and why each of them is highly appreciated. It is because each of these books have the priviledge of having an author or authors who have experienced physics and have their own method of communicating with the students. During my years as a physics teacher, I have developed a somewhat different methodology of presenting physics to the students. Concepts of Physics is a translation of this methodology into a textbook.\nThe book is one of the best books for physics.\n\nThe questions are very good.\n\nTHE TORRENT ONLY PROVIDES THE ANSWERS FOR THE EXERCISES.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd8ff643635be61a5439400a02174ed20ad2966a","amp;dn":"H+C+Verma+Concepts+Of+Physics+%28Solutions%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd8ff643635be61a5439400a02174ed20ad2966a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,143,246,67,99,91,230,26,84,57,64,10,2,23,78,210,10,210,150,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
