However, John's soldiers remain loyal to him and he sends a radio broadcast asking the other Resistance fighters not to attack Skynet. Meanwhile, Marcus enters the Skynet base and interfaces with the computer, disabling the perimeter defenses and allowing John to infiltrate the cell block and release the human prisoners. The Resistance's disabling signal is revealed to be a ruse, and the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard is destroyed by a Hunter-Killer.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________\n\nAVI File\n\nWidth: 640\nHight: 340\nFramerate: 29 f/ps\nAudio: 56 kbps\nLength: 01:46:38\nGenre: Action\nTagline: The End Begins\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\n\n* McG\n\n\n\nCast:\n\n* Christian Bale\n* Sam Worthington\n* Moon Bloodgood\n* Helena Bonham Carter\n* Anton Yelchin\n\n\n\n\nTrailer:\n\nTrailer (Flash)\nhttp://www.cinema.nl/media/4657620/trailer-terminator-salvation-van-mcg\n\nTrailer (Windows Media Player)\nhttp://www.mejane.com/trailers/play/11173/Terminator_Salvation.html\n\nTrailer (Quicktime)\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/terminatorsalvation\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\nIMDB User Rating: 7./10 (50,056 votes)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488\n\n\n\nEnglish subtitles added as .SRT file, remove that file to remove the subs.
