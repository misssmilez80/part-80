With Kiel Feher on Drums, Max McKee on Bass and Charley Orlando on Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica and Vocals they have forged a sound that combines a hard rockin' Americana feel. This band as a 3 piece has the ability to sound as large as 5 piece. The new album &quot;Free World Citizen&quot; is available as of 3/17/09 and is to be followed by a Midwest Rocky Mountain Spring Tour as well as Festival stops at Sterling Stage Folk Fest' in Sterling,NY and Summer Camp in Chillicothe,IL. Their recent opening for Enter The Haggis proved this band to be big stage ready!\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/04/16/charley-orlando/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15bebd7c5fb834c2405a0815e00cf9c85e07d80","amp;dn":"Charley+Orlando+Band...+Free+World+Citizen%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15bebd7c5fb834c2405a0815e00cf9c85e07d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,91,235,215,197,251,131,76,36,5,160,129,94,0,207,156,133,224,125,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
