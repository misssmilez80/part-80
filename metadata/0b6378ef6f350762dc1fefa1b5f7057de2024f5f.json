They're beset with taunting by the jocks of Alpha Beta fraternity, which only worsens when the jocks accidentally burn down their house and are forced toss the freshmen out of the freshmen dorm. To make matters more problematic, Lewis develops a crush on pretty Betty Childs, popular sorority sister and quarterback's girlfriend. Joined by the aptly named Booger and the violin-playing Pointdexter, the nerds soon realize they must form their own fraternity in self-defense. Soon the tables are turned as the nerds employ high-tech warfare against the jocks.... but can they really win and make a difference?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6378ef6f350762dc1fefa1b5f7057de2024f5f","amp;dn":"Revenge.of.the.Nerds.%5B1984%5D.720p.x264-H0neypoT.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6378ef6f350762dc1fefa1b5f7057de2024f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,99,120,239,111,53,7,98,220,31,239,161,181,247,5,125,226,2,79,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
