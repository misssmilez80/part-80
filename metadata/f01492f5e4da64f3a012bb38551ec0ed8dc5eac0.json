Only the fifth element can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Korben Dallas, who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rhod. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg, who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien mercenaries.\nCast\nBruce Willis - Korben Dallas\nGary Oldman - Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg\nIan Holm - Father Vito Cornelius\nMilla Jovovich - Leeloo\nChris Tucker - Ruby Rhod\nLuke Perry - Billy\nBrion James = General Munro\nTommy 'Tiny' Lister - President Lindberg (as Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Jr.)\nLee Evans - Fog\nCharlie Creed-Miles - David (as Charlie Creed Miles)\nTricky - Right Arm\nJohn Neville - General Staedert\nJohn Bluthal - Professor Pacoli\nMathieu Kassovitz - Mugger\nChristopher Fairban - Mactilburgh\nGenre:  Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller\nDirector: Luc Besson\nRated: Rated PG-13\n\nContainer: MKV\nFile Size: 460\n\nVideo\nCodec: H264 - MPEG - 4\nResolution: 1280X544\nFrame Rate: 23.976\n\nAudio\nCodec: MPEG AAC Audio\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nAAC Extension: SBR\n\nSubtitle: No\n\nScreenshots:\n&quot;http://www.pickaloo.com/photos/04-18-11/61763.jpg&quot;\n&quot;http://www.pickaloo.com/photos/04-18-11/61764.jpg&quot;\n&quot;http://www.pickaloo.com/photos/04-18-11/61765.jpg&quot;\n&quot;http://www.pickaloo.com/photos/04-18-11/61766.jpg&quot;\n\n\nDirect Download Link:\n\nCredits: To the orginal ripper(Thanks)\n\nNote: This is my 1st encode, in case of any suggestion, please post a comment.\n\nCHEERS!!!\n\nVYTO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01492f5e4da64f3a012bb38551ec0ed8dc5eac0","amp;dn":"The+Fifth+Element+1997+460MB+BDRIP+H264+AAC+-+VYTO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01492f5e4da64f3a012bb38551ec0ed8dc5eac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,20,146,245,228,218,100,243,160,18,187,56,85,30,192,237,141,197,234,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
