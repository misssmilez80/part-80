ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why Sony chose the Cell to drive its breakthrough PlayStation 3 and why Cell processors are at the heart of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most powerful supercomputers. But many developers have struggled to create high-performance Cell applications: the practical, coherent information they need simply hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t existed.\n\n\nProgramming the Cell Processor solves that problem once and for all. Whether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a game developer, graphics programmer, or engineer, Matthew Scarpino shows you how to create applications that leverage all the CellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extraordinary power. Scarpino covers everything from the CellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advanced architecture to its powerful tools and libraries, presenting realistic code examples that help you gain an increasingly deep and intuitive understanding of Cell development.\n\n\nScarpino illuminates each of the CellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most important technical innovations, introduces the commands needed to access its power, and walks you through the entire development process, including compiling, linking, debugging, and simulating code. He also offers start-to-finish case studies for three especially important Cell applications: games, graphics, and scientific computing. The Cell platform offers unprecedented potential, and this book will help you make the most of it.\n\nMastering the Cell SDK, including the GCC-based buildchain, ppu-gdb/spu-gdb debuggers, IBM Full System Simulator, and Cell IDE\nUnderstanding the CellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s central processing core, the PowerPC Processor Unit (PPU): structure, programming libraries, and AltiVec instructions\nProgramming the Synergistic Processor Unit (SPU): vector processing, communication, caching, assembler coding, and more\nLeveraging SDK vector and matrix libraries, including the Large Matrix Library, BLAS Library, FFT libraries, Multiprecision Library, and Monte Carlo API\nCoding basic 2D graphics using the Linux frame buffer\nBuilding 3D graphics with the new Gallium OpenGL library\nConstructing 3D games with Ogre3D and packaging them using Collada digital content interchange\nOptimizing the performance of your Cell applications\nDeveloping on standard PCs and transferring code to Cell systems such as the PlayStation 3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1325b0ed1c0329346610d7cf00be1c14f73bd8","amp;dn":"Programming+the+Cell+Processor+-+%28Malestrom%29+%28CHM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1325b0ed1c0329346610d7cf00be1c14f73bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,19,37,176,237,28,3,41,52,102,16,215,207,0,190,28,20,247,59,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
