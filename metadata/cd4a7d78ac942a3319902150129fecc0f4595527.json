But the terror is not over. Now a U.S. Agent, former Raccoon Police Officer Leon Kennedy has been dispatched on a mission to Europe to save the President's daughter from a &quot;crazed organization&quot; that bares a striking behavioral resemblance to creatures found in the Arklay Mountains. Is there a connection between these foes and the horrible nightmares from the past? Discover the answer for yourself in Resident Evil 4.\n***\n\nI have also added a trainer.
