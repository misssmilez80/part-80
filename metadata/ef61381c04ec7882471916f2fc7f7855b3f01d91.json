Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 6-9)\n\nTransferred, digitally SQ-decoded, restored and remastered \nfrom the original quadraphonic vinyl edition, made in the UK 1975. \nThis disc is playable on any DVD player but will give best results\nwhen played on a player with the DVD-Audio logo.\n\nTransfer: EMT 950 (BBC Edition) with TSD 15 moving coil stylus &gt;\nPrism sound 24 bit A/D converter &gt; Cedar Cambridge HD. \nSQ-decoding with Adobe Audition 3. Script by kempfand (www.quadraphonicquad.com)\nAudio restoration with Cedar Cambridge.\nMastering with Adobe Audition 3.\nDVD-Authoring with Spruce Maestro and DiscWelder Chrome II.\n\nDVD-Audio:\n24 bit MLP (Quadraphonic)\n\nDVD-Video:\n24 bit dts (Quadraphonic)\n16 bit Dolby Digital (Quadraphonic)\n24 bit Linear PCM (original SQ-Stereo, accessible from DVD-A as well)\n\np. 1975 Pink Floyd Music Ltd.  \nReworked by tom 2009.\n\nNote: There were two previous bootleg releases of this record recently but \nboth suffered from being very dull and lifeless, especially the vocals sounded \nrather muddy. \nThey claimed they were decoded with the famous Fosgate II analogue decoder, so \nI thought this device would be the reason for the poor reproduction of the high \nrange. But when I got the Quad-vinyl disc, I had to discover that the LP-sound \nactually was rather dull in itself, so I had to EQ-tweak it a lot to match \nthe sound of the WYWH remaster CD.\nFor some strange reasons the previous DVD-A bootleg release had the end of \nShine On II attached to the end of Welcome To The Machine as well, giving the \nimpression that this was a feature of the record. It wasn't, of course.\nHowever, the quad master is a different compilation, notably the transitions between \nHave A Cigar and Wish You Were Here and between some of the parts of Shine On You \nCrazy Diamond II run slightly longer than on the stereo version.\n\nFREE TRADE ONLY!
