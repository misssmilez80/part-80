He first appeared in Warlord v1 #48 (August 1981), and was created by Roy Thomas and Ernie Colon.\n\nArak was surprisingly culturally sensitive for the time when it debuted. Unlike other Native American heroes, like Apache Chief, who took a cartoonish view of Native Americans similar to the old western movie Indians, Arak did not have broken speech or other stereotypical &quot;Indian&quot; traits.\n\nOne of the last surviving members of the Quontaka tribe of North America in the 9th century, the young Arak was found on the open sea by a Viking Ship.  Arak was raised by the Viking tribe and an adult, he joined them on their travels to medieval Europe.  After a fierce battle with a sea serpent Arak which kills all the Viking raiders Arak searches for a way to return to his North America.  Arak would often encounter figures and creatures from real-world myth and legends, including Greek, Norse, Judeo-Christian, Muslim, Oriental, and others.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd77461c65476876565b0a863209f7530f2db3a","amp;dn":"Arak+-+Son+of+Thunder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd77461c65476876565b0a863209f7530f2db3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,215,116,97,198,84,118,135,101,101,176,168,99,32,159,117,48,242,219,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
