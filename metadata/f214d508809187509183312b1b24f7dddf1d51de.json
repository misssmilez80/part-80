He has discovered not only in the writings of\nJames (who has recently been studied extensively from the phenomenological\npoint of view) but those of Dewey also, strong\ntendencies and incipient gropings toward such a consummation.\nHe has brought out the inherent tensions in the attempts of James\nand Dewey to 'penetrate' nature through a descriptive-phenomenological\nanalysis of experience. The author recalls how James constantly\nhad to defend himself against the SUbjectivistic interpretations\nof his theory of 'pure experience' by critics, and how Dewey\nadmitted the 'circularity' involved in his procedure in reply to his\nopponents. Nevertheless, James remains in the author's view a\npowerful precursor, and Dewey an able continuator, of an American\nbrand of naturalistic phenomenology of experience and knowledge.\nAnd yet, these laudable attempts were hampered by that strange fascination\nfor making an absolute beginning in philosophizingwhich\nJames and Dewey, despite their varied background and training,\nshared with Husserl. It is in the writings of Farber, who is\nheir to the tradition of both Husserlian phenomenology and American\nnaturalism and realism, that the author finds a fully conscious\nand articulate development of naturalistic phenomenology based on\na critique of the subjectivistic and idealistic implications of Hussed's\nlater writings. Farber's principle of 'ontological monism'\ncoupled with 'methodological pluralism' is seen to be free from\nthe 'compulsive' search for a presuppositionless beginning. It places\nthe phenomenological description 'of e~perience in its proper context\nof general methodology in which other methods, such as experimental\ninquiry, dialectical method of social-historical analysis,\nlanguage analysis, and formal-conceptual analysis all play their legitimate\nrole for a total understanding of man and his place in nature.\nSuch a 'logically weighted' naturalism leaves out nothing\nwhich can be descriptively discovered and adequately supported by\nlogical canons. In conclusion, the author emphasizes the importance\nof Farber's writings in performing the historical function of 'containing'\nthe 'irrational' off-shoots of phenomenology in the various\nforms of 'existentialism,' retaining a cherished place for phenomenological\nanalysis within general methodology, and working out a\nprogram of an adequately supported American brand of naturalistic\nphenomenology by drawing out the implications of a trend already\ndiscernible in the writings of James and Dewey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f214d508809187509183312b1b24f7dddf1d51de","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1973%5D+Naturalistic+Philosophies+of+Experience+Studies+in+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f214d508809187509183312b1b24f7dddf1d51de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,20,213,8,128,145,135,80,145,131,49,43,27,36,247,221,223,29,81,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
