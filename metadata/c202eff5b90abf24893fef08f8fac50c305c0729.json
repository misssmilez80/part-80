It includes a collection of GNU/Linux software especially for system administrators and users of texttools. Grml provides automatic hardware detection. Grml is the perfect rescue system, but you can also use it for analyzing systems/networks or as a working environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk; you don't even need a harddisk to run it. Due to on-the-fly decompression Grml includes about 2 GB of software and documentation on the live system.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2011.05/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2011.05/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grml.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grml.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c202eff5b90abf24893fef08f8fac50c305c0729","amp;dn":"grml-small_2011.05.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c202eff5b90abf24893fef08f8fac50c305c0729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,2,239,245,185,10,191,36,137,63,239,8,248,250,197,12,48,92,7,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
