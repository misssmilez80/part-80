Shortly after the recording of this LP, King's husband and musical partner died, sort of taking the wind out of the sails (and sales) of the LP's release. \n\nIt's wonderful to have Carole King's &quot;Welcome Home&quot; album on CD, thanks to this Japanese pressing. The cardboard sleeve is a little larger than the standard CD shape and makes this release unique. Most regard this album as a failure because it did not generate hits and had poor sales. The set was recorded in January 1978. Rick Evers who was Carole's husband died of a drug overdose on March 21 of that year, which clouded the album's release in May. For Carole King fans, there are reasons to cheer. &quot;Venusian Diamond&quot; may have been a homage to the Beatles, but is a strong song with one of Carole's dreamiest melodies, &quot;Then there appeared a serpent hanging like a thunder rope. He said, &quot;Pull me.&quot; I did &amp; fell into the wrong end of a telescope.&quot; &quot;Morning Sun&quot; is a lovely track with Richard Hardy's flute giving a sunny cheerful feel to the arrangement and Carole in fine voice, &quot;In the morning the sun comes shining through my window &amp; it's good to be alive.&quot; &quot;Ride the Music&quot; is also a delightful track that sounds like a carnival ride with Hardy's clarinet solo. I'm sorry this album is so overlooked because it still sounds great to my ears.
