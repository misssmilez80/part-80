Why is this superior software being sold for\n        about the same price as the competition?\n\n        There's no catch, the fact that Auction Auto Bidder is by far the\n        most sold sniper on eBay is what allows this superior software to\n        be sold for such a low price! But this low price may not stay\n        forever, depending on the success of this new version, the price\n        may be increased.\n\n        No hidden fees or monthly costs, only a one time purchase price.\n        Guaranteed to not contain any spyware and adware.\n\n        1822 registered users, most of the many suggestions they sent are\n        now part of Auction Auto Bidder!
