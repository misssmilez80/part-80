This allows e.g. console access (see http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/PC_Tweaks section &quot;Show/Hide console windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ), all you need is to edit your WillowInput.ini!)\n- debugger allowed (new) (i.e. no ptrace trick). Useless for playing, so ignore this if you don't know what it means.\n\nPlease report in a comment if you have issues or none.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c1fefd4a31af948938dbebc355e02c92362682","amp;dn":"Borderlands+1.0.1+%5Bk%5Ded+including+playable+DLCs%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c1fefd4a31af948938dbebc355e02c92362682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,193,254,253,74,49,175,148,137,56,219,235,195,85,224,44,146,54,38,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
