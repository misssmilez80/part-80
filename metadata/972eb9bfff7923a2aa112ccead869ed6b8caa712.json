The album entered the UK album chart at no.1 and has since sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK alone, being certified quadruple platinum. It was also a success in the U.S. where it was a top 30 hit and has sold in excess of 2,700,000 copies there.\n\nIn 1993 the album was included in Q magazine's list of the &quot;50 Best Albums Of 1992&quot;. Rolling Stone magazine (6/25/92, p.41) described the album as &quot;...state-of-the-art soul pop...&quot; and it is included in Rolling Stone's (5/13/99, p.56) &quot;Essential Recordings of the 90's&quot; list. Several songs from the album were released as singles with &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; and &quot;Little Bird&quot; being the most successful.\n\nThe song Keep Young and Beautiful was included on the CD release as a bonus track (the original vinyl album had only ten tracks). Another bonus track, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, appeared on the Mexican and Japanese editions of the album and was also included as the B-Side on the single &quot;Precious&quot;. The song was later recorded by Whitney Houston for the 1996 film soundtrack The Preacher's Wife and subsequently became a hit single.\n\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1993 Brit Awards.\n\nAll songs written by Annie Lennox except where noted.\n\n&quot;Why&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53 \n&quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12 \n&quot;Precious&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08 \n&quot;Legend in My Living Room&quot; (Annie Lennox, Peter-John Vettese) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n&quot;Cold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 \n&quot;Money Can't Buy It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 \n&quot;Little Bird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48 \n&quot;Primitive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n&quot;Stay by Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26 \n&quot;The Gift&quot; (Annie Lennox, Robert Bell, Paul Buchanan, Paul Joseph Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52 \n&quot;Keep Young and Beautiful&quot; (Al Dubin, Harry Warren) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17 \n\nIan Cooper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mastering \nAnton Corbijn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ photography \nDave Defries ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet \nMarius de Vries ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, programming \nKenji Jammer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, programming \nSteve Jansen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drum programming \nLouis Jardim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion \nLuis Jardim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion \nKeith LeBlanc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \nAnnie Lennox ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, vocals \nSteve Lipson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, keyboards, programming, producer \nPaul Joseph Moore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards \nHeff Moraes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ engineer, MIDI manager \nBill O'Donovan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mixing assistant \nSatoshi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ photography \nEdward Shearmur ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano \nLaurence Stevens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ design \nPeter-John Vettese ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, programming, recorder \nDoug Wimbish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass \nGavyn Wright ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ violin \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:972eb9bfff7923a2aa112ccead869ed6b8caa712","amp;dn":"Annie+Lennox...Diva%281992%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"972eb9bfff7923a2aa112ccead869ed6b8caa712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,46,185,191,255,121,35,162,170,17,44,206,173,134,158,214,184,202,167,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
