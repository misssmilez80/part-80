Now released for the first time on DVD-RIP and including all six episodes from the first series (DVD 1 of The Complete Stressed Eric Collection)\n\nEric Feeble is 40, a divorced father with two kids and a crippling mortgage. His son is thick, his daughter is allergic to everything and his au-pair is an unreliable waster. The successful and wealthy Perfect family, who live next door, provide a constant and irritating reminder of what his life could have been. At work, a series of stress related illnesses have seen him demoted from Sales through half a dozen offices to the dark, dank wastelands of the Data Department, next to the GentlemenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lavatory. Through it all Eric battles on, a man whose very survival each week against impossible odds makes him an ulcer-growing hero for our times.\n\n\nStressed Eric S1E01 - Nativity\nStressed Eric S1E02 - Sex\nStressed Eric S1E03 - Pony\nStressed Eric S1E04 - Hospital\nStressed Eric S1E05 - Potato\nStressed Eric S1E06 - Tidy\n\nDivx Avi\\'s HQ DVD RIP!\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3f6b5756515450515356515a7f5356495a115c50114a54&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nDVD RIP REQUESTED!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670ef8dc9b855d7f7d154faf1d472f6966c9e861","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Stressed+Eric+-+Series+1+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670ef8dc9b855d7f7d154faf1d472f6966c9e861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,14,248,220,155,133,93,127,125,21,79,175,29,71,47,105,102,201,232,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
