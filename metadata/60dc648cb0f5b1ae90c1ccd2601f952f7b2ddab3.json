Whether it's \nBarnes own It Will Be Alright or his emotive cover of The Band's \nclassic The Weight. These stripped down acoustic arrangements show \nthe best of what Barnes was and is capable of.\nWhen you toss in some guest spots with Aussie rock luminaries like\nDiesel, Tommy Emmanuel, Ross Wilson, The Badloves, Deborah Conway \nand Archie Roach. The mix ends up being an even more well-rounded \nand a delightful treat.\n\nThe performances are relaxed but not restrained and completely \nunpretentious and the vocals are some of Barnes' strongest. \nThe only truly weak moment is his cover of Elvis Presley's Love \nMe Tender which neither adds nor takes away anything from the \noriginal performance making it an unoffensive, if not bland, \ncover.\n\nHighlights Of the 20 Tracks Performed live, include Barnes cover \nof the Cold Chisel classic Flame Trees, Ride the Night Away, and \nhis stirring duet with Deborah Conway-- Let It Go.                                                                                           \n\nSource: Pal Colour Dvd 5 Region 4 Dolby Digital\n\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 480                                        \n\nVideo Demuxer: Avi                                          \n\nVideo Format: XviD                                          \n\nVideo Bitrate: 2038kbps                                                \n\nVideo Framerate: 25fps                                           \n \nVideo Codec: ffodivx                                                  \n                                                                 \nAudio: English                                           \n\nAudio Channels: 2 [AC3]                                      \n\nAudio Bitrate: 192kbps                                       \n\nAudio Frequency: 44100hz                                              \n                                                       \nAudio Codec: Mp3                                               \n\nFile Size: 1.33Gb                                           \n                                                               \nPlay Duration: 85Mins 33Secs                                      \n\nComments: I hope you all enjoy this great music video as much as \nI do, But please be patient with my initial upload as I only have \na maximum upload speed of 25kbps.
