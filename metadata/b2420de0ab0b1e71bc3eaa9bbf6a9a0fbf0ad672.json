His family, however, is a little different from most families. \n\nHis father is Don Vito Corleone, a powerful Mafia boss known as &quot;the Godfather.&quot; His brothers Sonny and Fredo are soldiers in the organization and Sonny is the most feared enforcer in New York. His adopted brother Tom Hagen is the lawyer who handles the financial details of the family business. Scattered around the wedding reception are such luminaries as legendary hit man Luca Brasi, world-famous singer Johnny Fontane, and Mafia capo Dominic Clemenza. \n\nAfter the reception, Don Vito, Sonny, and Tom, meet with Virgil Sollozzo, a drug smuggler who wants them to become partners in his business. Though Sollozzo offers attractive terms, Don Vito declines the offer. \n\nWhen, a few days later, the Don is cut-down and seriously wounded by a pair of assassins, the violent Sonny is tapped to take the reigns of the family and vows to avenge his father. \n\nIn the midst of the resultant gang-war, &quot;college-boy&quot; Michael volunteers to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, his police protection. Meeting with the two in a small restaurant, Michael slays them both with a hidden pistol. \n\nWhile Michael heads to exile in Sicily, Sonny continues the gang-war, now battling both the other five New York families and the police. When Sonny dies in a hail of gunfire, Don Vito returns from his convalescence to forge a new peace with the other families and even manages to arrange for someone else to be convicted of the murders Michael committed, allowing his youngest son to come home. \n\nWhen the Don is finally felled by a heart attack and Fredo is sent to consolidate the family's power in Las Vegas, Michael is called upon to take control of the family business and take revenge on his enemies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2420de0ab0b1e71bc3eaa9bbf6a9a0fbf0ad672","amp;dn":"THE+GODFATHER+%5BOsheraj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2420de0ab0b1e71bc3eaa9bbf6a9a0fbf0ad672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,66,13,224,171,11,30,113,188,62,170,155,191,106,154,15,191,10,214,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
