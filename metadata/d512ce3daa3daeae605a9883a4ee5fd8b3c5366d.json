Heath,\n        a team founded  by workers from  the Lancashire and  Yorkshire\n        Railway in 1878. This is where this DVD starts, recounting the\n        history of  Manchester United.  Honours soon  followed and the\n        first of seven First Division titles was won in 1908. With  an\n        FA Cup win  the following year,  and another league  title two\n        years  later,  Manchester  United  were  firmly   establishing\n        themselves as a force in English football.\n\n        The history continues: Old Trafford was bombed during the  war\n        and we  witness the  painful rebuilding  process before moving\n        into  an  era   of  great  success   and  tragedy  under   the\n        inspirational management of Sir  Matt Busby. He was  the first\n        manager to lead an English club into Europe before the  Munich\n        plane  crash  prematurely  robbed  football  of  his brilliant\n        'Busby Babes'.  But Busby  and 'United  were not  to let  this\n        tragedy defeat  them as  Busby created  another brilliant team\n        starring Charlton, Best and Law  that was to shine in  England\n        and go on to win the European Cup.\n\n        In the years  after Busby's resignation,  FA Cups followed  at\n        regular  intervals but  the League  Championship continued  to\n        elude United  until Sir  Alex Ferguson  built the  team of the\n        nineties that  have gone  on to  win seven  premiership titles\n        over the last  ten years. Built  around home-grown talent  and\n        inspirational signings such as Eric Cantona, Manchester United\n        moved into an  era of unrivalled  success which culminated  in\n        the remarkable treble of 1999. But Manchester United's history\n        does not  stop there.  Further championships  followed in both\n        2000 and 2001 and this  DVD finishes at a time  when Ferguson,\n        through the  signings of  Ruud van  Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian\n        Veron and  Rio Ferdinand  is building  another team  worthy of\n        success at home and in Europe.\n\n                Extras: \n\n                1.
