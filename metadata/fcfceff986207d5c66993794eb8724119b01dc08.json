He is a minimalist, know this up front, and take joy in the fact that he is a student of great songwriters including Leonard Cohen, Townes Van Zandt and Isaac Brock. In his latest set of songs, Galbreath comes at the listener with teeth showing, wearing pain like a badge. The set begins with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Will Be Waiting,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a reverse loop that sounds like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being used to raise the dead, and then comes Her Horses on vocals like some blind poet giving revelations. So a reverse loop, a choir of ghosts and hard scrabble verses make the oncoming storm break from the gates and strike like a southern copperhead never seen. This one and the next four songs make up what I would describe as the first half of the record or side A of the LP. All five songs here use minimal instrumentation and minimal lyrics to say much with little. An exception might be the almost joyous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMake Me Famous,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which begins with soft keyboards and quickly becomes an anthem for a pub crawl about the devils of fame. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSouthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the song that seems to me as the shifter in tone, it begins with ice-pick piano and GalbreathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chorus of voices recalling youthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s baptism that soon sounds like an ode to debts unpaid and a lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of regret. In this lays the beauty of Her Horses. A beautiful picture of the war, so catchy at times that you find yourself being reeled in to listen at the rhymes and there you are poisoned by cold observations of a world that man has witnessed and felt since the clay began to breath.\n\n\n\n1.
