His wife no        \n         longer wants him and he will do anything to      \n         make his family whole again. As time passes      \n         Tom finds that he can no longer tell reality     \n         from fiction and that every action he takes      \n         results in dire consequences. When Tom loses     \n         everything, what will he do to get it back?      \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [ ] Fullscreen  4:3        [*] English                        \n         [*] Widescreen 16:9        [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n          [23.976] Framerate         [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n         [624x336 ] Resolution      [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n                                    [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [ ] Other                          \n                                                                       \n                                    [mp3@128kbps       ]               \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [*] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [*] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [790 ] Bitrate                         [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [0] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                Enjoy!                                                            \n                                                                       \n       Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: NOVO INSECTS VOMIT SADPANDA SPiCE SMeG         \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP NTX XPRESS THUGLiNE  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
