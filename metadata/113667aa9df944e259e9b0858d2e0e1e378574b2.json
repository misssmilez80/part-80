Cookutils is one of the new generation of tools to build SliTaz packages and provides a Build Bot with a nice web interface that works out-of-the-box on any SliTaz system. These new packages have been built with a new i486 optimized toolchain.\nThe full boot process has been improved and the first boot configuration is now done through GTK boxes in a X session and the boot time is also faster. This version comes with a new GUI tool for system configuration as well as our new system configuration panel aka TazPanel. TazPanel lets you configure the entire system via a xHTML/CSS web interface (useful for remote control) and it also handles package management and replaces the old GTK box.\nXorg now has dri support, so libdrm, linux-drm as well as linux-agp are part of the core ISO. This adds 1Mb to the compressed root filesystem. But we managed to save a lot of space in the core ISO with our new packages and this new Cooking is 30Mb! This new cooking also provide better internationalization and Italien support!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.slitaz.org/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.slitaz.org/en/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : 01387ea355343946ab74ea6272f518eb  slitaz-cooking-20110531.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113667aa9df944e259e9b0858d2e0e1e378574b2","amp;dn":"slitaz-cooking-20110531.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113667aa9df944e259e9b0858d2e0e1e378574b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,54,103,170,157,249,68,226,89,233,176,133,141,46,14,30,55,133,116,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
