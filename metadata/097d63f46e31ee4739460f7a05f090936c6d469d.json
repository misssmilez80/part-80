Here's a PS2 game called Echo Night: Beyond. After making an image out of the disc, I burned it to see if the image was made properly. It isn't perfect (it makes some ticking noises), but apparently it is working.\n\nThis game is really creepy. I think it's pretty damn good. So if you like it, please seed it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:097d63f46e31ee4739460f7a05f090936c6d469d","amp;dn":"%5BPS2%5D+Echo+Night+-+Beyond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"097d63f46e31ee4739460f7a05f090936c6d469d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,125,99,244,110,49,238,71,57,70,15,122,5,240,144,147,108,109,70,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
