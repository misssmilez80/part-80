From copying music off your        \n    iPod to copying photos on, XPlay fills in the holes giving you        \n    more power to manage your music, photos and more.                     \n                                                                          \n    XPlay 3 has always given you direct access to your iPod, meaning      \n    when you plug in your iPod it is listed as a drive on your system.    \n    Now that power is added for iPhone and iPod touch users. There is     \n    no application, no middle man to get in the way. Simply click on      \n    your iPod and start organizing.                                       \n                                                                          \n    XPlay also believes in cross-platform harmony. XPlay includes         \n    MacDrive technology enabling you to use both Mac and Windows          \n    formatted iPods with any XP or Vista computer. You also get           \n    management options. While XPlay is the perfect complement to          \n    iTunes, XPlay also makes it possible to use your iPod with Windows    \n    Media Player or Vista Media Center.                                   \n                                                                          \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/&lt;/a&gt;                              \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    1.
