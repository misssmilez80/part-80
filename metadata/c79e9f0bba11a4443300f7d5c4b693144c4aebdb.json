The Soft Hearted Scientists hail from Wales and deserve much more attention than they have received to date, therefore I am uploading this, their best album so far in FLAC format for you to enjoy.\n\nThe NME praised it in their review and summed it up as &quot;a new legal high has been unleashed&quot;. Think of Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd mixed with the textures of a Moody Blues album with some psycadelic Beatles thrown in but brought into the 21st century kicking and screaming and you'll have a rough approximation of the Soft Hearted Scientists' sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c79e9f0bba11a4443300f7d5c4b693144c4aebdb","amp;dn":"Soft+Hearted+Scientists+-+Uncanny+Tales+From+The+Everyday+Underg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c79e9f0bba11a4443300f7d5c4b693144c4aebdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,158,159,11,186,17,164,68,51,0,247,213,196,182,147,20,76,74,235,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
