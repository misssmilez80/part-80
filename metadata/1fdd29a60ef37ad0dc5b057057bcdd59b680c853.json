Diesel stars as Xander Cage, a nihilist extreme sports enthusiast nicknamed &quot;Triple X&quot; because of a large tattoo covering his back and neck. Cage's illegal stunts and poor attitude (he's given to spouting dialogue such as, &quot;Have you ever been punched in the face for talking too much?&quot;) land him in jail, where he's recruited/blackmailed into government service by the National Security Agency's Augustus Gibbons, who likes Cage for his skills and expendability. The new secret agent is assigned to infiltrate a Russian crime ring called Anarchy 99, whose access to biochemical weaponry is making the United States extremely nervous. With the help of some high-tech gadgets from weapons master Toby Lee Shavers (Michael Roof), Cage is able to make his way into Anarchy 99, where he targets the group's leader Yorgi (Marton Csokas) and falls for the organization's second-in-command, Yelena (Asia Argento). XXX (2002) is the first in a hoped-for franchise of sequels for the film's producer, Revolution Studios.\n\n\nMpaa Rating++++++++++\n\nRated PG-13 for violence, non-stop action sequences, sensuality, drug content and language.\n\n\nRetail Release Date++++++++\n\n9 August 2002\n\nDVD Content++++++++++\n\n\nMain Movie+++++++++++++++\n+Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n+Audio-English, French\n+Subs-English, French\n\n\nMenu+++++++\n+Yes \n\nExtras/Special Features+++++\n+Yes\n\nRemoved++++++++++++++\nFBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\nChapters++++++++++++++\n\n1.
