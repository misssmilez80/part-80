Collaborators prior to making the film, Hansard and IrglovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ \ncomposed and performed all of the original songs in the movie.\n\nShot for only ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬130,000 (US$160,000),the film was successful, earning \nsubstantial per-screen box office averages in the United States.[4] It \nreceived enthusiastic reviews[5][6] and awards such as the 2007 Independent \nSpirit Award for best foreign film. Hansard and IrglovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡\\'s song \\&quot;Falling Slowly\\&quot; \nreceived a 2007 Academy Award for Best Original Song and the soundtrack as a whole \nalso received a Grammy nomination.\n\nOnce spent years in development with the Irish Film Board. It was during a period \nwhere the film board had no chief executive (for about 6 months) that the film was \ngiven the go-ahead by a lower level executive on the proviso that the producers \ncould make it on a budget of approximately 150,000 euros and not the initial higher \nbudget.\n\nPlot\n\nAn unnamed, thirty-something Dublin busker (listed in the credits as \\&quot;Guy\\&quot;, played by \nGlen Hansard) sings and plays guitar on Grafton Street, a Dublin shopping district. He \nstruggles with the trials of performing on the street, including chasing after a heroin \naddict (Darren Healy) who attempts to steal his earnings. Lured by his music, an unnamed \nyoung Czech immigrant flower seller (listed in the credits as \\&quot;Girl\\&quot;, played by MarkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ta \nIrglovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡) approaches him and, despite his annoyance, persists in questioning him about his \nsongs. Delighted to learn that he also repairs vacuum cleaners in his father\\'s shop, she \ninsists that he fix her broken cleaner.\n\nThe next day she brings her Hoover by and parlays it into lunch together, whereupon she \npiques his interest by telling him that she is a musician, too. He asks to hear her play, \nso they visit a music store where she regularly plays piano. After teaching her one of \nhis songs (\\&quot;Falling Slowly\\&quot;), which she quickly learns to play, they sing and play the \nsong together, kindling a musical and potentially romantic connection. He invites her and \nher ailing vacuum back to his father\\'s shop, and on the bus home musically answers her \nquestion as to what his songs are about: a long-time girlfriend who cheated on him, then \nleft (\\&quot;Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\\&quot;).\nOnce stars Glen Hansard and MarkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ta IrglovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡\n\nAt the shop, he repairs her vacuum and she meets his father (Bill Hodnett), who seems \nindifferent to his son\\'s musical talent. The Guy takes the Girl up to his room, but when \nhe asks her to stay the night, she is insulted and leaves. The next day, he apologizes \nand they quickly patch things up, as over the course of a week they excitedly write, \nrehearse and record songs, and get to know each other. Songs continue to be performed \nin a real-world, diegetic fashion, often in their entirety, as when the Girl rehearses \nher lyrics for one of the Guy\\'s songs (which she entitles \\&quot;If You Want Me\\&quot;), singing to \nherself while walking down the street, or when at a party, people perform impromptu \n(including \\&quot;Gold\\&quot;, performed by a trio featuring guitarist Hansard singing harmony).\n\n\n\nTheir flirtation continues, but at the same time, he is thinking about and writing about \n(\\&quot;Lies\\&quot;) his ex-girlfriend (Marcella Plunkett), who moved to London. The Girl encourages \nhim to move there, win his girlfriend back and pursue his musical career. Invited home to \ndinner by the Girl to a house set in Mountjoy Square, the Guy discovers that she has a \ntoddler (Kate Haugh) and lives with her mother (Danuse Ktrestova). He soon decides that \nit is time to move to London, but he wants to make a high-quality demo of his songs to \ntake with him and asks the Girl to record it with him. She takes the lead as they secure \na bank loan - from a bank where the loan officer (Sean Miller) is a musical hobbyistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and \nreserve time at a professional studio.\n\nOn a romantic motorbike jaunt aboard his father\\'s 1966 6T Triumph Thunderbird, she reveals, \nmuch to his consternation, that she is married, though her estranged husband is back in the \nCzech Republic. When Guy asks if she still loves her husband, she answers in Czech, \\&quot;Miluju \ntebe\\&quot;,[7] but coyly declines to translate what she said. In the Czech language it means \\&quot;It \nis you I love.\\&quot; After recruiting a trio of musicians (Gerard Hendrick, Alaistair Foley, Hugh \nWalsh), they rehearse, then go into the studio to record. Their lack of experience shows, but \nthey quickly impress the jaded studio engineer Eamon (Geoff Minogue) once they begin recording \ntheir first song (\\&quot;When Your Mind\\'s Made Up\\&quot;). On a break in the wee hours of the morning, the \nGirl finds a piano in an empty studio and finally plays the Guy one of her own compositions \n(\\&quot;The Hill\\&quot;), which tells of romantic frustration. She breaks down before finishing the song \nand he responds by asking her to come with him to London, but is not prepared for the reality \nof her mother coming along to help with the baby.\n\n\n\nStill, he is smitten. After the all-night session wraps up successfully, they walk home. Before \nthey part ways, the Girl reveals that she spoke to her husband and he is coming to live with her \nin Dublin. The Guy asks her to spend his last night in Dublin with him; she says that it would \nonly result in \\&quot;hanky-panky\\&quot;, which is a \\&quot;bad idea\\&quot;, but after the Guy\\'s pestering she ultimately \nagrees to come over. In the end, she stands him up and he cannot find her to say goodbye before \nhis flight. He plays the demo for his father, who, moved and impressed, gives him money to help \nhim get settled in London. Before leaving for the airport, the Guy buys the Girl a piano and \nmakes arrangements for its delivery, then calls his ex-girlfriend, who is happy about his \nimminent arrival. The Girl\\'s husband (Senan Haugh) moves to Dublin and they reunite.\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 702 MiB\nDuration : 1h 22mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 182 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 22mn\nBit rate : 1 057 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.188\nStream size : 627 MiB (89%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 22mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 112 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 66.7 MiB (10%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 539 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07fd258bd093ae7ecf56d1e251c5a0ee2a2f3da1","amp;dn":"Once+2006+Xvid+%5BHectorbusinspector%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07fd258bd093ae7ecf56d1e251c5a0ee2a2f3da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,253,37,139,208,147,174,126,207,86,209,226,81,197,160,238,42,47,61,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
