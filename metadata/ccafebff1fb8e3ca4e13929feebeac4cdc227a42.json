Few moments of Really Don't Mind would sound out of place on one of Miles Davis's early '70s albums (putting aside, of course, the lack of trumpet). More than half of the album's six cuts run well over the ten-minute mark. There is little pre-arranged structure to hold onto (...). The artwork is beautiful, song titles lettered in tightly jumbled '70s pop-art clouds, with mysterious drawings throughout - all fine advertisements for the weirdness within.\n\n(http://www.jambands.com/reviews/cds/2006/05/14/really-don-t-mind-if-you-sit-this-one-out-mushroom)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccafebff1fb8e3ca4e13929feebeac4cdc227a42","amp;dn":"Mushroom+-+Don%5C%27t+Mind+If+You+Sit+This+One+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccafebff1fb8e3ca4e13929feebeac4cdc227a42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,175,235,255,31,184,227,202,78,19,146,159,238,190,172,76,220,34,122,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
