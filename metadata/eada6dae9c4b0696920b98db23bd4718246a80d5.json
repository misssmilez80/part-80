GEN-B2 and above upgraders. I could not get them to work correctly so i did a little searching and found some better and easier drag and drop upgraders.\n\nNow this is only for the FATS (1000) and Early Pre-V3 Slims (2000) but i thought i'd upload it just to get a better guide out there seeing as alot of players still have m33 and can't very well play 5.50+ games without getting someone to mod them, when its a waste of time if you'd just update :P \n\nVery CLEAR instructions inside but if you have any questions shoot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eada6dae9c4b0696920b98db23bd4718246a80d5","amp;dn":"PSP+m33-3+to+GEN-D2+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eada6dae9c4b0696920b98db23bd4718246a80d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,218,109,174,156,75,6,150,146,11,152,219,35,189,71,24,36,106,128,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
