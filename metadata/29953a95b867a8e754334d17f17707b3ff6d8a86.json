But none compare to the lion. The Serengeti sustains one of the biggest lion populations in Africa: approximately 3,500 lions in 300 prides. But this pride, residing in the central Serengeti, is an exception. 22 lions in all: they are a Super Pride. Few lion prides reach Super Pride status. This phenomenon requires the right conditions. Plentiful prey and strong pride males are key to its success. But keeping cubs alive to maturity is the Super Pride's ultimate goal. Sometimes the greatest threats to a lion cub's life come from other lions.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 699 MiB for 47mn 0s 754ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 952 Kbps\nAspect            : 592 x 368 (1.609) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 113 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29953a95b867a8e754334d17f17707b3ff6d8a86","amp;dn":"Super+Pride+%282007%29-+National+Geographic+%5BWS-PDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29953a95b867a8e754334d17f17707b3ff6d8a86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,149,58,149,184,103,168,231,84,51,77,23,241,119,7,179,255,109,138,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
