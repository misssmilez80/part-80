I'm sharing this game because even though the graphics on this game aren't great by any means, the gameplay is a blast. The physics are good and the controls are great.  Each type of vehicle has its own characteristics and it's fun to try them all.\n\n=============================================================================\n\n\nThe Baja 1000 is the most grueling challenge on two ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or four ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ wheels. The legendary race runs through the desolate landscape of the Baja California peninsula and just finishing the race ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ let alone placing - is an accomplishment as the rugged terrain takes its toll on machine and rider. Activision captures all the gut-wrenching, fist clenching action in Baja 1000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ developed in cooperation with Score International, the organization that stages the annual race.\n\nNow you can take on the unforgiving conditions at breakneck speeds in any of 90 vehicles representing the multiple classes of racers. Go where bigger vehicles can't on a Quad or dirt bike, or power fearlessly over obstacles that would stop a lesser racer in your trophy or monster truck. Hyper-realistic dirt and damage modeling mean that speed alone won't win the race as you battle opponents through desert canyons and across punishing dirt tracks where the wrong move can put you out of the race and parts will come off just from the rough treatment. Even moderate damage builds up and too much will affect your top speed and handling.\n\nThe open highways and streets of the small Mexican towns don't offer much respite as your competitors will try to gain position. Your vehicle will respond differently on dirt, sand, mud or asphalt so your strategy will constantly shift. Jump in for a quick race or buckle in for the long haul to progress through all eight grueling stages. Challenge the clock or a local player five career events, or go online with 8-player events. There's a shortcut up ahead, can your ride take it?\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\nWindows XP/Vista\nDirectX 9.1\nPentium III 1.3Ghz Processor\nMemory 256MB\nHard Drive 3.0GB Free\nDVD-ROM\nGraphics Card 128MB DirectX Compatible\nSound Card 16-bit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16bfdb18d23291ccb6c2590bbc095b57c0ef630","amp;dn":"Score+International+Baja+1000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16bfdb18d23291ccb6c2590bbc095b57c0ef630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,107,253,177,141,35,41,28,203,108,37,144,187,192,149,181,124,14,246,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
