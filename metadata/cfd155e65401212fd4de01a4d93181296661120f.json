This is almost certainly a pan-cultural album, citing both Eastern (Asia), and western influences...a focus on less tracks and stronger compositions is the template to which the stunning epic opener of &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; with it's oriental gong's, flutes, guitar (acoustic), and quintessential Hong Kong melodrama evokes the film score from &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, and its instrumental brilliance is only matched by its ambition. The first vocal track &quot;A Love Song&quot; neatly encapsulates Jah wobbles strongest attributes...coaxing inspired vocals from collaborative vocalists (in this case female singer &quot;Natacha Atlas&quot;), who lends a tremendous singing performance in her native tongue. By the time the epically changing &quot;Gone To Croatan&quot;...a 15 minute orchestral worldbeat track with legendary bassist &quot;Bill Laswell&quot; performing, or the western percussionist flavoured &quot;Hit Me&quot; with the very subtlest elements of deft turntable scratching (with Turntable virtuoso &quot;Rob Swift&quot;) bring things a to a extremely satisfying conclusions....you'll no doubt be in agreement, that this is unarguably Jah Wobbles greatest (solo) album.....truly captivating.
