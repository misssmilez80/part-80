The actors intentionally parrot lines in an emotionless fashion as the story about two seemingly murderous, vaudeville magicians unfolds. Chuckie (Charles Ludlam) and Mikey (Michael Burg) borrow from models like Peter Lorre characters or the Marx Brothers in their antics. Their assistant Tina (Ellen McElduff) is of a dual sexual persuasion, apparently. One of her liaisons (Peter Evans) turns out to be a bit of an imposter himself but a lot can be forgiven because of the cash that comes with him.\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140281/\nRATING: 5.2/10 \t12 votes\n\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,468,157,952\nRuntime ...............: 1:52:24\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 161688\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ............: 656x496\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1625\n\nAudio Codec ...........: MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 VBR\nNo. of audio streams ..: 2\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4096990377/in/set-72157622787056184/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4097747834/in/set-72157622787056184/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4097747984/in/set-72157622787056184/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4097748066/in/set-72157622787056184/\n\n\nNOTE: Preceding the film is a trailer to Mark Rappaport's film FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG (1995).\n\n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
