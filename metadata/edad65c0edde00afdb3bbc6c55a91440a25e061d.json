Potts is flown into Nazi Germany to impersonate the spy and instructed to seek out and bring back details of a new German secret weapon.\nOn arrival, however, Potts is placed in charge of a group of apparently rabidly-fascist young students who are being trained to work as spies in England. Potts attempts to undermine this by convincing the youngsters that the proper British way of saluting a great leader is to apply the V-sign, which they therefore do repeatedly and enthusiastically in the direction of a portrait of the FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrer. At a function where he hopes to gather information about the weapon (a gasfire bomb), Potts succeeds only in getting blind drunk and admitting that he is a British agent. Luckily, his class of Nazi youths turn out to be sympathetic Austrians and they help him obtain the secret he seeks. Potts and his new friends eventually commandeer a plane and fly back to England, crashing in a tree outside the War Office in London.\n[edit]Cast\n\nWill Hay as William Potts/Muller\nCharles Hawtrey as Max\nFrank Pettingell as Professor Hoffman\nJulien Mitchell as General Von Glotz\nPeter Ustinov as Krauss\nBarry Morse as Kurt\nLeslie Harcourt as Vagel\nPeter Croft as Hans\nAnn Firth as Lena\nRay Lovell as Schmidt\nJeremy Hawk as ADC\nAubrey Mallalieu as Rector\nJohn Williams as Major Bishop\nLawrence O\\'Madden as Colonel Truscott\nWilliam Hartnell as German Officer at Station (uncredited)\n\nPLEASE SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edad65c0edde00afdb3bbc6c55a91440a25e061d","amp;dn":"The+Goose+Steps+Out.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edad65c0edde00afdb3bbc6c55a91440a25e061d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,173,101,192,237,222,0,175,219,59,188,108,85,169,20,64,162,94,6,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
