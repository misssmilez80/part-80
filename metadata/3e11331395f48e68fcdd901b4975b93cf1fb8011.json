It remains to be seen how     \n     affected you are of the End User License Agreements (EULAs).      \n     They can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.                \n                                                                       \n     According to the &quot;DMCA ACT&quot; in the Unites States, you have no     \n     rights to circumvent a copy protection. Beware, they will         \n     punish you harder than if you stole the shrinkwrapped software    \n     in a mall.
