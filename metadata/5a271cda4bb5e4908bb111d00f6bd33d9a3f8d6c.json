When one of his proteges locates the elusive Nazi war criminal Dr. Josef Mengele (Peck), famed Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman (a wonderful Olivier) stumbles on Mengele's grand scheme to murder 94 seemingly unconnected men -- a scheme that could somehow launch the Fourth Reich.\n\nThe character of &quot;Josef Mengele&quot; is based on the real-life Nazi doctor Mengele, who performed inhuman genetic experiments on thousands of Jews, both children and adults, at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland during World War II. Mengele managed to escape capture at the end of the war, and in reality was never found. Laurence Olivier was named Best Actor of 1978 by the National Board of Review. His character, &quot;Ezra Lieberman,&quot; was loosely based on noted Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Scenes set in Paraguay and Brazil were, in fact, shot in Portugal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a271cda4bb5e4908bb111d00f6bd33d9a3f8d6c","amp;dn":"The+Boys+from+Brazil+Dvdrip+H264+Bookerdog.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a271cda4bb5e4908bb111d00f6bd33d9a3f8d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,39,28,218,75,181,228,144,139,177,17,208,15,107,211,61,154,63,141,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
