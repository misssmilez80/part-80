The album produced a hit single, &quot;What?,&quot; as well as remixes of both sides of the band's first single, &quot;Memorabilia&quot; and &quot;A Man Could Get Lost.&quot;\nNon-Stop Ecstatic Dancing is widely recognized as being one of the first house records in the UK, as well as the first record in the UK to feature turntable scratches. However, it is notable that the scratch sounds heard on the record were not created on actual turntables but, rather, on producer Mike Thorne's modular Serge synthesizer.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Memorabilia\n[02] Where Did Our Love Go\n[03] What\n[04] A Man Could Get Lost\n[05] Chips On My Shoulder\n[06] Sex Dwarf\n \n\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 00h:28m:02s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 68.4 mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320 khps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Punk Rock\n\nOriginally Release\t\t- 1982\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Phonogram Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.marcalmond.co.uk/ \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984e60028886957ecb931721292fb7ced22c8d47","amp;dn":"%5B1982%5D+Non+Stop+Ecstatic+Dancing+%5BEP%5D+-+Soft+Cell+-+68+4mb+%40+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984e60028886957ecb931721292fb7ced22c8d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,78,96,2,136,134,149,126,203,147,23,33,41,47,183,206,210,44,141,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
