Here is what I have available if anybody is looking for some quality talk radio. There are about 17 folders, about 14 of which with full day broadcasts. Enjoy.\n\nR.I.P. Maxwell Show, at least I was able to recover these precious files for nostalgic reference. The rest of the thousands of podcasts are lost forever, never to be heard again. If anybody has any other recordings, pls comment.\n\nOne or more from the following days:\n\n6-17-09\n6-18-09\n9-28-09\n9-30-09\n10-6-09\n10-7-09\n10-8-09\n10-12-09\n10-15-09\n10-27-09\n10-28-09\n10-29-09\n11-4-09\n11-6-09\n11-10-09\n11-12-09\n\n\n***The 10-6-09 folder is a double of 10-7. Would recommend unchecking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9951595da729ac89b644ffb5550b258022437b4b","amp;dn":"Maxwell+Show+Podcasts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9951595da729ac89b644ffb5550b258022437b4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,81,89,93,167,41,172,137,182,68,255,181,85,11,37,128,34,67,123,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
