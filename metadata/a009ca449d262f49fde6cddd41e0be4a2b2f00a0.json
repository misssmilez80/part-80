The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files.\n\n\n\nBLP 1507  The Jazz Messengers At The Cafe Bohemia, Vol. 1\nKenny Dorham (tp) Hank Mobley (ts) Horace Silver (p) Doug Watkins (b) Art Blakey (d)\n&quot;Cafe Bohemia&quot;, NYC, 1st set, November 23, 1955\ntk.5\tMinor's Holiday\nKenny Dorham (tp -1) Hank Mobley (ts) Horace Silver (p) Doug Watkins (b) Art Blakey (d)\n&quot;Cafe Bohemia&quot;, NYC, 2nd set, November 23, 1955\n1. tk.6\tSoft Winds\n2. tk.10\tAlone Together\nsame personnel\n&quot;Cafe Bohemia&quot;, NYC, 3rd set, November 23, 1955\ntk.12\tPrince Albert\nsame personnel\n&quot;Cafe Bohemia&quot;, NYC, 4th set, November 23, 1955\ntk.19\tThe Theme\n** also issued on Blue Note BST 81507 (pseudo stereo), CDP 7 46521-2.
