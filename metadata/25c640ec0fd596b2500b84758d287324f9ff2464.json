Major is apparently one of the best-known record collectors on the East Coast and, along with Jesper Eklow, supplies Endless Boogie with equally endless guitar solos and raspy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvocalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ calling to mind that dude from Kings of Leon channeling Iggy Pop. They only play shows when specifically asked, gained some street cred when Stephen Malkmus begged them to open for him in 2001, and released some uber-rare, long out-of-print vinyl offerings before dropping Focus Level last month. You canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t accuse them of failing to keep it real.\n\nFocus Level clocks in at 70+ minutes and contains two types of songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the (relatively) concise riff rockers with discernible vocals and then double digit noodling where the listener is immediately transported to, say, 13:27 of that hot ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlayinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the BandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-jam from your favorite ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢72 Dead tape. The latter tunes find Paul Major trading wordy verses for grunts and Mike Patton-esque vocal gesticulations. They also significantly outnumber the shorter songs, which is too bad because, at least on record, EB is far more raging when they keep it brief and focused.\n\nSo good is seven-minute opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmoking Figs in the YardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: Over three chords and torrents of greasy slide work, Major barks about what sounds like the greatest red-blooded American BBQ ever, where ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe grill is on! / The meat is cookinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢! / Once again!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while the lucky attendees get to smoke all manner of figs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin the baaaackkyaord! With my friends!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ One gets the feeling that redneck poseurs like Kid Rock would sacrifice a gonad to hang with these guys, but rest assured that Endless Boogie have no idea who he is. SOTY candidate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComing Down the StairsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ even manages to one-up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFigsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ glorious choogle, transferring the rock from the backyard to the barroom floor for the Pee-Wee Herman breakdance anthem of your wildest dreams. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMove BackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ completes the shorter = better triumvirate with a three minute wah-heavy stomp that could pass for a Stooges track.\n\nAnd the remainder of Focus Level consists of fantastically named songs (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Manly Vibe,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSteak Rock,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGimme the AwesomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and fantastically lengthy guitar solos, most of which just sound like in studio jam sessions with rolling tape. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no question that Eklow and Major are adept and adventurous guitarists schooled in all manner of white-boy blooze rock. But the jams meander and suffer from sounding like more-fun-to-play than actually-listen-to, though end up ideal for nodding off to on long train rides or marathon bong sessions. So, Endless BoogieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jamming is not of the relatively less predictable, Trey Anastasio-like ilk, just all pentatonic, all the time.\n\nFocus Level features too much filler to rate an unqualified success, though it does contain two of the most smoldering summertime rawk songs in recent memory. Still, considering the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s merits as a cohesive statement or not, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible to feign cheer for these guys, a sentiment that will ring even truer after you witness them live. Endless Boogie simply come off as humble, as four good humored pals that canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite believe that they put out a record, let alone one that people other than themselves would want to listen to. \n\n\n&quot;On their 1968 album Living the Blues, Canned Heat set some kind of jam-endurance record with the live 40 -minute track &quot;Refried Hockey Boogie.&quot; The New York quartet Endless Boogie go even further ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 79 minutes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on their fantastic, note-perfect update of electric-blues drone and railroad rhythm, Focus Level (No Quarter). The album is divided into 10 so -to -speak songs, such as the Can-like chug &quot;The Manly Vibe&quot; and &quot;Executive Focus,&quot; a dead ringer for a 1971 Pink Fairies wig-out. But the cumulative effect of the hog -sneeze distortion, twin -guitar skirmishes and John Lee Hooker -style chooglin! is nonstop stoner-rock delight. The vocals are cartoon -demon yowling, but the rest is as authentic as my old Groundhogs LPs. Singer-guitarist Top Dollar (the band members use pseudonyms) is also a renowned rare-record dealer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ real name Paul Major ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who has now made an album as freaky as those he sells.&quot; - Rolling Stone\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
