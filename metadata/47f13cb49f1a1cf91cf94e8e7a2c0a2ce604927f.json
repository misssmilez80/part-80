These recordings are straight from the Master Tapes and not sourced to vinyl or CD issues.  Here is what Mike had to say:\n\nThe 2 covers from Sweet &amp; X are listed, this is a compilation of demos and both records, Dress Up &amp; Die and Blacklight 13, released on Buy Our Records from New Jersey from 1986 to 1988.\n\nAdrenalin OD later covered our song Coffin Cruiser. \n\nMore info and purchasing info for both LPS, rare 45, AOD covers EP and original merch can be found at:  www.nuclearjackalope.com\n\nAnd for anyone who wants to talk to Mindless, look him up at the Johnny Thunders forum at http://chatterbox.freeforumboard.net\t\n\nUPLOAD by MJG196 a.k.a.
