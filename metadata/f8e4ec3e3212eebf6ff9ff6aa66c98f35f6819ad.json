The term was coined by the German American historian Karl August Wittfogel (1896ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1988), in Oriental Despotism (1957). Wittfogel asserted that such &quot;hydraulic civilizations&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ although they were neither all located in the Orient nor characteristic of all Oriental societies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were essentially different from those of the Western world. More recently, the idea of practical orientalism has emerged from the original field of orientalism envisioned by Edward Said[2] and Wittfogel amongst others. Practical orientalism considers the creation of the binaries created in elements of everyday routine[3]. In a modern neoliberal economic setting, concepts of common ownership and equal and universal access rights often emerge as exotic or oriental, creating as described below situations of contemporary hydraulic empire and resource control.\n\nMost of the first civilizations in history, such as Ancient Egypt, Sri Lanka, Mesopotamia, China and pre-Columbian Mexico and Peru, are believed to have been hydraulic empires. The Indus Valley civilization is often considered a hydraulic empire despite a lack of evidence of irrigation (as this evidence may have been lost in time due to flood damage). Most hydraulic empires existed in desert regions, but imperial China also had some such characteristics, due to the exacting needs of rice cultivation.\n\n[edit] Analysis\nWittfogel argues that climate caused some parts of the world to develop higher levels of civilization than others. He is known for claiming that climate in the Orient led to despotic rule. These arguments for climatic determinism are today echoed by the work of scholars such as Jared Diamond who suggests in his work Collapse that climatic and environmental determinants have been the central factor determining the rise and fall of empires[4]. This environmental determinism comes to bear when considering that in those societies where the most control was exhibited, this was commonly the case due to the central role of the resource in economic processes and its environmentally limited, or constrained nature. This made controlling supply and demand easier and allowed a more complete monopoly to be established, as well as preventing the use of alternative resources to compensate.\n\nThe typical hydraulic empire government, in Wittfogel's thesis, is extremely centralized, with no trace of an independent aristocracy -- in contrast to the decentralized feudalism of medieval Europe. Though tribal societies had structures that were usually personal in nature, exercised by a patriarch over a tribal group related by various degrees of kinship, hydraulic hierarchies gave rise to the established permanent institution of impersonal government. Popular revolution in such a state was impossible: a dynasty might die out or be overthrown by force, but the new regime would differ very little from the old one. Hydraulic empires were only ever destroyed by foreign conquerors.\n\nWittfogel's ideas, when applied to China, have been harshly criticized by scholars such as Joseph Needham who argued essentially that Wittfogel was operating from ignorance of basic Chinese history. Needham argued that the Chinese government was not despotic, was not dominated by a priesthood, had lots of peasant rebellions, and that Wittfogel's perspective does not address the necessity and presence of bureaucracy in modern Western civilization.\n\nThe same elements of resource control central to hydraulic empire were also central to Europe's colonization of much of the global South. Colonies were resource rich areas located on the periphery, and the contemporary models of core-periphery interaction were focused on the extraction and control of these resources for the use of the core.[5] This was accomplished through a type of agro-managerial despotism with close connections to debates around hydraulic empire.\n\n[edit] Contemporary application\nStruggles and debate around rights to water access and use for both agriculture and also fundamentally for human consumption remain an issue, outside of simply historical cases. In recent decades there has been increased debate around the status of water as a &quot;human right&quot;, a resource which cannot be owned and which all should have access to for their own use and survival.\n\nControl over water emerged as a major issue in Latin America in the 1990s following World Bank loans to Bolivia to modernize and later privatize the municipal water systems of La Paz-El Alto and Cochabamba. The Bolivian government auctioned the public utilities in charge of water and sold them to Aguas del Tunari, a subsidiary of Bechtel[6]. Terms of this contract stipulated that control over all water in Cochabamba was the property of Aguas del Tunari. This became a major clashing point as almost 40% of the city was receiving its water from informal systems not linked to the city's water supply[7].This effectively signaled the end of campesino and local control of water, and meant that the new corporate owners would have the right to place Bolivian water on the international market, effectively establishing hydraulic control over the cities involved.[8]\n\nCases such as Bolivia's and that of China's with the Three Gorges Dam Project are examples for some of modern neocolonialism manifested in hydraulic empire.[citation needed] While the colonial nature of these projects is debatable, the use of the term helps discourse by introducing further the concept of control for the gain of the removed or the few. At the heart of colonial theory, is the idea of the core being served by the periphery, a resource rich area lacking the technology or capital to exist as a core of its own or exploit its own resources. It is thus exploited 'for its own benefit' by another group who with the power and means to exploit the resources, thus controls them. In the wake of widespread poverty, major international debt and resource or energy deficits, governments such as those of Bolivia and China will inevitably risk becoming hydraulic empires.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e4ec3e3212eebf6ff9ff6aa66c98f35f6819ad","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1967%5D+Oriental+Despotism+A+Comparative+Study+of+Total+Pow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e4ec3e3212eebf6ff9ff6aa66c98f35f6819ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,228,236,62,50,18,238,191,111,249,255,106,166,108,152,243,95,104,25,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
