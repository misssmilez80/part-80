Thank you.\n\nHue and Cry (1947) is a British film directed by Charles Crichton and starring Alastair Sim, Harry Fowler and Joan Dowling.\n\nIt is generally considered to be the first of the &quot;Ealing comedies&quot;, although it is better characterised as a thriller for children. Shot almost entirely on location, it is now a notable historic document due to its vivid portrait of a London still showing the damage of World War II. London forms the backdrop of a crime-gangster plot which revolves around a working-class children's street culture and children's secret clubs.\n\n\nThe 39 Steps is the original 1935 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, loosely based on the adventure novel The Thirty-nine Steps by John Buchan. The film stars Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll.\n\nThere have been four major film versions of the book. Hitchcock's original has been the most acclaimed, and remains so today: \n\n\n\nThe Ghost Goes West\n\nPeggy Martin (Parker), the daughter of a rich American businessman (Eugene Pallette), persuades him to purchase a Scottish castle from Donald Glourie (Robert Donat), dismantle it and move it to Florida. Along with the castle goes its ghost.\n\nMurdoch Glourie (Donat again) haunts the castle after dying a cowardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in the 18th century. To find rest, he must get a descendant of the enemy Clan MacClaggan to admit that one Glourie is worth fifty MacClaggans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71112420df98546bda2a56e5520c40639d938867","amp;dn":"THREE+BRITISH+FILMS++5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71112420df98546bda2a56e5520c40639d938867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,17,36,32,223,152,84,107,218,42,86,229,82,12,64,99,157,147,136,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
