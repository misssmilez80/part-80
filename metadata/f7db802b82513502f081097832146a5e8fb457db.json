Cameron plays army scout Kirby Frye, who has been assigned to track down a stolen cache of weaponry. Frye suspects that local troublemaker Martin Gavin (James Millican) is the criminal mastermind, but he needs proof. The film matriculates into a tense cat-and-mouse game between Frye and Gavin, culminating in a long-overdue action finale. Cavalry Scout was lensed in Cinecolor, a pleasing two-color process which Monogram reserved for its prestige productions. The film was produced by Walter Mirisch, who'd later turn out such &quot;A&quot;-flicks as The Apartment, West Side Story and The Great Escape.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043391/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043391/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:17:19\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x384  1,46:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1140 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7db802b82513502f081097832146a5e8fb457db","amp;dn":"Cavalry+Scout+%281951+Rod+Cameron+VHSrip+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7db802b82513502f081097832146a5e8fb457db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,219,128,43,130,81,53,2,240,129,9,120,50,20,106,94,143,180,87,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
