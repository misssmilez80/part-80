Combine that with a fast driving blend of punk, pop, psychobilly, solid songwriting and a witty Sci-Fi theme, and you've got one of the East Bay's most celebrated bands, The Phenomenauts.\n\nConceived in the amazing year 2000 and hailing from &quot;Earth's capital&quot; of Oakland, California, The Phenomenauts are true galactic pioneers on a mission to entertain with their unique brand of &quot;Rocket-Roll&quot;. The Phenomenauts gained early recognition as the East Bay's &quot;craftiest and bravest band&quot; (East Bay Express) for their now infamous commando-style performances in which they set up in front of large music venues, such as the legendary Fillmore in San Francisco, and perform rollicking sets powered by car batteries for unsuspecting crowds. These early &quot;missions&quot; landed them on the cover of multiple bay area publications, including The San Francisco Weekly, The East Bay Express and Independent Musician Magazine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20bc70e167138ced73227823dc21a6257c43aa4b","amp;dn":"the+Phenomenauts+-+For+All+Mankind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20bc70e167138ced73227823dc21a6257c43aa4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,188,112,225,103,19,140,237,115,34,120,35,220,33,166,37,124,67,170,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
