I decided I wanted to not read, but listen to this book.  So I purchased it on a (unnamed website) thinking I could download it in MP3 format and listen to it on my car or PC..etc\n\nWell I quickly found out that was bullshit impossible.  Mostly due to them saying &quot;If we give it to you in MP3 you'll just pirate it away&quot; and told me I could listen to it on fucking MACs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, a limited amount of smartphones, and bullshit that wont let me listen to the fucking things I BOUGHT in my car when I'm driving 4 hours a day.  And they said if I wanted to burn it, I could burn it ONCE using iTunes, which I say FUCK THAT!\n\nSo I just hit play using their bullshit software on my netbook, and had a headphone jack looped to the microphone and recorded it using Audacity.  So FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING PRICKS!  NOW IT'S IN MP3 FORMAT BECAUSE YOU'RE ASSHOLES!  Here's a free book, because some companies can fuck off.\n\nMP3 format\n76 chapters = 76 MP3's\n128 kbps\n44100Hz\n\n\n\nbtw, fucking sweet book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb3d389c4b059d2fe96005c7832fe6e2ecba3007","amp;dn":"Halo+Cole+Protocol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb3d389c4b059d2fe96005c7832fe6e2ecba3007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,61,56,156,75,5,157,47,233,96,5,199,131,47,230,226,236,186,48,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
