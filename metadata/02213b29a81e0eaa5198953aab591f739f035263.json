While watching a race at McKinley Speedway for a break from studying, college student Nick O'Bannon (Bobby Campo) has a premonition of a car crash which sends debris into the audience, crushing some spectators and resulting in the stadium collapsing, which would have killed everyone present in the 180 section. In a panic Nick manages to convince his girlfriend Lori Milligan (Shantel VanSanten), and friends Hunt Wynorski (Nick Zano) and Janet Cunningham (Haley Webb) to leave. The quartet is followed out by a security guard named George Lanter (Mykelti Williamson), a car mechanic Andy Kewzer (Andrew Fiscella), his girlfriend Nadia Monroy (Stephanie Honore), and racist Carter Daniels (Justin Welborn), who have become angry with Nick (except for Janet, who was scared to leave the race track in the first place, and George) after he pushes past them to escape. Cynthia Daniels (Lara Grice), wants to follow her husband, but was ordered by Carter not to. Also, mother Samantha Lane (Krista Allen) follows her family outside. George intervenes when everyone begins to argue outside, just as the catastrophe Nick had foreseen occurs. A tire flies over the arena and splatters Nadia's head (shortly after Nadia dies, Cynthia probably was sliced in half like in the premonition). After a memorial service at McKinley Speedway, Carter and Samantha died violently in freak accidents: Carter is burned alive with his tow truck after trying to burn a cross on George's lawn as revenge for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkilling his wifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Samantha is killed by a flying rock propelled by a lawnmower - the rock being thrown on the lawn by her obnoxious kids, which goes right through her eye (the clue to her death is that she said the her kids &quot;I got my eye on you&quot;). Right before their deaths, Nick had seen omens of how they would die.\n\nAfter hearing about Carter and Samantha's deaths on the news, Nick and Lori begin doing research, and learn about the disasters that occurred in the previous three films and discover that the survivors (who were saved by premonitions) began dying in a series of improbable accidents shortly afterward. While Hunt and Janet refuse to believe them, Nick and Lori manage to convince George that Death is after them. The trio begins trying to warn Andy, only to see him killed when a COÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² canister flings him backwards through a chain-link fence which dices his torso. As they learn Hunt and Janet are next, they split up to save both of them in time. Lori and George go to save Janet, which is successful, as they find Janet in a carwash, having her head stuck through her sunroof after escaping being drowned from the amount of water pouring into her car. They save her right before her head gets crushed by a huge pipe in the carwash. Meanwhile, Nick goes to a pool to look for Hunt, who dies after he unintentionally switches the lever for draining the pool on and after he dives to look for his lucky coin his intestines are sucked down the pool drain violently.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1144884/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1144884/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02213b29a81e0eaa5198953aab591f739f035263","amp;dn":"Final-Destination.4.2009.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02213b29a81e0eaa5198953aab591f739f035263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,33,59,41,168,30,14,170,81,152,149,58,171,89,31,115,159,3,82,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
