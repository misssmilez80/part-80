It's been a long and exhausting journey, but the focus has been unwavered throughout! We would like to thank Dan Kincaid for his non-stop dedication and determination, mixing, producing and pushing us to achieve a great, brutal and true metal CD! The 5-song Debut will be available very very soon....\n\nAs for now,....ENJOY THE BRUTALITY!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14e995241325639b4f447ee3a83d6f97ae651909","amp;dn":"Sinstorm+2009+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14e995241325639b4f447ee3a83d6f97ae651909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,233,149,36,19,37,99,155,79,68,126,227,168,61,111,151,174,101,25,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
