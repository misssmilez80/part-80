Thanks for downloading this iso. Make sure you seed to at least 1.2 ratio. Thanks :)\n\nThis Windows 7 iso includes:\n\nei.cfg fix / One Disc Mode - You can install any version of Windows 7 from 1 disc, more info here: http://www.anandtech.com/weblog/showpost.aspx?i=630\n\nCode 5 Error fix - This disc will boot fine in older PCs with AMI BIOS, more info here: http://www.unawave.de/windows-7-tipps/code5-error.html?lang=EN\n\nMore info about the error: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproinstall/thread/4ea4b21b-d425-4719-98ad-05af21489025\n\nUpgrade from Windows 7 Beta / Release Candidate - The cversion.ini file has been modified so you can upgrade from the beta / RC. No reinstall is necessary. \nMore info here: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/3075/how-to-upgrade-the-windows-7-rc-to-rtm/\n\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nThe only steps needed is to burn the iso to a clean dvd and then boot from the DVD.\n\nTo burn this iso, use the included USB-DVD Tool (Windows7-USB-DVD-tool.exe). You can boot it from a thumb drive also. Just install the tool and browse to your iso file. Another alternative is to use ImgBurn (http://www.imgburn.com/) but that is only for discs.\n\nIf you need a crack, just search up 7loader. I won't post any direct links however.\n\nNo components have been removed (services, tools, accessories, etc.). The iso was based off an MSDN image, and the hashes do match Microsoft's Official RTM release hashes. \n\nSource:\n\nHashes: http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/07/24/windows-7-rtm-build-7600-16385-official-sha-1-and-md5-checksum-hash-for-original-msdntechnet-dvd-iso-images/\n\n\n\nInstall and enjoy :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33b90fb03b34b8f7be155136e8208d07f44ef095","amp;dn":"Windows+7+x86+Code+5+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33b90fb03b34b8f7be155136e8208d07f44ef095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,185,15,176,59,52,184,247,190,21,81,54,232,32,141,7,244,78,240,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
