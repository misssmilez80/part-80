It always seems that they are inches away from a massive breakthrough and reaching a level of success that their peers have acheived much quicker. Their debut was a raw, heavy album that fused melody with blistering metal, and the follow-up, 2000's 'The Height Of Callousness' took what was already there and bulked up their sound with the use of electronics. 'Self-Destructive Pattern' is the culmination of those two albums. Both sides of the coin are presented here and Spineshank have turned out not only their heaviest, but their catchiest album to date. Songs like &quot;Violent Mood Swings&quot; and &quot;Dead To Me&quot; will kick you around the room until they finish, well &quot;Smothered&quot; and &quot;Beginning Of The End&quot; have Spineshank showing a softer &amp; catchier, yet unrestrained style. The pinnacle of this album to me is the slow-burning &quot;Stillborn,&quot; which is the perfect fusion of metal and electronica. Other standouts include: &quot;Consumed,&quot; &quot;Slavery,&quot; and &quot;Forgotten.&quot; I definitely recommend that if you like any kind of heavy music, you pick this up. Spineshank are experts at what they do. They know how to bob your head without snapping it off and they are just now reaching full maturity. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5eb496a34e932e6ddf24f3e31e071d55943389c","amp;dn":"Spineshank+-+Self-Destructive+Pattern+%282003%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5eb496a34e932e6ddf24f3e31e071d55943389c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,235,73,106,52,233,50,230,221,242,79,62,49,224,113,213,89,67,56,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
