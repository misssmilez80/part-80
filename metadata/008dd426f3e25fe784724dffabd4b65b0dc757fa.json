You lose!&quot;\n\n\n\ncIOSCORP v3.5 does not modify IOSes 4, 16, 51, 57, or 61.\n\n\n\nExtras Installer:\n\ncmios (WiiGator)= mios v4 with WiiGator's GC Backup Launcher embedded\n\n\t\t  into it.\n\ncmios (waninkoko)= waninkoko's cmios, but uses mios v4 as a base,\n\n\t\t  instead of mios v5.\n\ncIOS55 rev13 DIP= cIOS55 v5149 with rev13 DIP. Supports Dual Layer\n\n\t\t  discs, but may not fix #001 error properly.\n\ncIOS55 rev14 DIP= cIOS55 v5149 with rev14 DIP. Properly fixes #001\n\n\t\t  error, but does not support Dual layer discs.\n\n\n\nWhat is needed (other than this package):\n\n- A Nintendo Wii (to modify)\n\n- A non-SDHC Card with heaps of free space (preferably a blank 1GB\n\n  or 2GB card)\n\n- Ability to run Wii homebrew (e.g. Homebrew Channel installed)\n\n- waninkoko's cIOS249 installed, to run the installer\n\n\n\nOptional, but recommended:\nbootmii (preferably as boot2):\n\nWe highly recommend installing bootmii, and making a NAND backup,\n\nand/or installing preloader prior to installing cIOSCORP v3.5.\n\npreloader:\n\nAlso, installing preloader with a hacks.ini for your System Menu is\n\nrecommended, as it has some useful hacks, such as region free games.\n\n\n\nHow risky is it to install?\n\ncIOSCORP v3.5 overwrites the majority of the system files (IOS)\n\non your Nintendo Wii with modified ones which &quot;know&quot; how to handle\n\nDVDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±R discs, so the installation process itself can be quite risky.\n\nYou should be fine if you just let the installer run though.\n\n\n\nTHIS PACKAGE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, NIETHER EXPRESS NOR\n\nIMPLIED. THIS (AS WITH ANY OTHER MODIFICATION) WILL ALSO VIOD ANY\n\nOFFICIAL NINTENDO WARRANTY THAT YOU MAY HAVE. WE (da_letter_a &amp;\n\ndamysteryman) ARE NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THIS MAY\n\nCAUSE TO YOUR NINTENDO WII CONSOLE! YOU USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nIF YOU DAMAGE YOUR NINTENDO WII, IT IS ENTIRELY YOUR OWN FAULT!\n\n--------- END ------------\n\nI have included both the installer and uninstaller in this torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:008dd426f3e25fe784724dffabd4b65b0dc757fa","amp;dn":"cIOSCORP+v+3.5+%28run+Wii+back-ups+from+DISC+Channel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"008dd426f3e25fe784724dffabd4b65b0dc757fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,141,212,38,243,226,95,231,132,114,77,255,171,212,182,91,13,199,87,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
