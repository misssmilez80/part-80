Later Sara is attacked by a dog and they recall that in the other side of the island there was a facility for training dogs that had been shutdown to avoid a rabies outbreak. While walking through the woods, they find a man called Luke, who sailed with his girlfriend Jenny to the island, covered of blood and Luke is killed by a pack of hounds. The group runs to the house and the animals put the place under siege, and they try to find a means of escape. When the survivors reach the compound, they disclose that the dogs have been genetically redesigned to become a breed of killers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5b2914c48aced35704025494789280950a5ac7","amp;dn":"The+Breed.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5b2914c48aced35704025494789280950a5ac7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,91,41,20,196,138,206,211,87,4,2,84,148,120,146,128,149,10,90,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
