It makes organizing your pictures and getting them to look great as simple as pressing the button on your camera. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll save time, have a barrel of fun and your friends and family will be really impressed. Almost everything is done with a couple of clicks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ adding picture frames, correcting your photos, making greeting cards, collages and slide shows, sharing your pictures on CDs/DVDs or your website and much more. Ashampoo Photo Commander 6 is a one-stop solution. You organize and view your photo collection, edit and enhance your photos and use creative editing and project tools all in a single program. And it also manages your audio and video files!\n\nIntuitive new interface\nThe new tabbed ribbon-style interface puts all the functions at your fingertips. You can always see what functions are available and everything is so self-explanatory you will probably never need to consult the manual. Includes elegant Vista-style buttons in Windows XP and very cool transition effects when you switch between photos in full-screen editing mode.\n\nQuick-Fix Tools\nAll the common operations you need to perform on your photos are now available in the Quick-Fix Tools tab: One-click color and contrast optimization, photo straightening (if the camera wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t straight), red eye correction, cropping, rotating and more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all with a couple of clicks.\n\nEditable objects\nYou can add additional photos, text boxes, geometric shapes, arrows and more to your images. And now you can save them in a new file format that lets you go back again edit the objects again later without having to start right from the beginning.\n\nPowerful new screen capture functions\nThe screen capture function now uses the latest technology from AshampooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s award-winning Magical Snap 2. It includes full support for capturing Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transparent Aero Glass effects and capturing on multi-monitor systems. You can also capture free-style shapes as well as the standard rectangular objects and fixed shapes, and apply cool drop shadow, edge and shape effects automatically while capturing.\n\nQuick 5-star rating system\nEvery photo displayed in the Organizer has a line of 5 stars under it. To rate your photo you just click for between 1 and 5 stars. You can then sort by star ratings to quickly find your favorite photos.\n\nEmailing multiple photos and movies\nNow you can email multiple photos in a single PDF file, which many people like a lot more than mails with a whole list of separate photo attachments. You can also press Ctrl+E to mail one or more photos or other media files quickly. And of course Photo Commander will resize your pictures for you to make them easier to send.\n\nFeatures:\n- New interface: Ribbon style tabbed interface with Vista style buttons on XP\n- Adjustable dialog box sizes: user settings are saved\n- Quick-Fix Tools: All common operations with a couple of clicks\n- Editable objects: New file format stores objects you add on editable layers\n- Unlimited Undo/Redo: For all changes\n- Browser EXIF mode: Shows all the photoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s EXIF/IPTC information directly under the picture\n- Quick 5-star ratings: Just click to rate photos with 1-5 stars, supports sorting by rating\n- Enhanced thumbnails: Better looking thumbnails stored with lossless compression\n- Enhanced searching: In subfolders and by EXIF and IPTC data\n- New screen capture technology: Capture free-style shapes, Vista Aero Glass effects and more, full multi-monitor support\n- Improved Wizards: Wizards guide you through procedures with a clearer, even more intuitive layout\n- Email to PDF: Mail multiple images in a single PDF file\n- Batch optimization: Apply the new One-Click Optimization tool to all your selected photos in one quick and easy process\n- Slide shows with audio: Add more than one audio track to your slide shows\n- JPEG-XR support: The program supports the new Windows HD Photo format\n- CD/DVD burning tools: Burn your photos and slide shows directly to CDs and DVDs without leaving the program.\n- Batch processing: Convert multiple photos to other formats and apply effects, all at the same time.
