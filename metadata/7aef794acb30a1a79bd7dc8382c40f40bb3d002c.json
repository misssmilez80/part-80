Tyler (Derek Baynham) brings his college buddy Chase (Charlie David) home for the summer to hang out with his surprisingly hot dad, Nathan (Dan Payne), and mom, Stacey (Thea Gill, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Queer as FolkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½).

Can Nathan remain true to himself and keep his family together?\n\n\nI added Spanish &amp; Italian subtitles using the method described in the link below with all free tools.\nHow to add new subtitles to an existing DVD &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.videohelp.com/topic338721.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.videohelp.com/topic338721.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI did not remove anything, no compression.\n\nNOTE the Spanish &amp; Italian subs can not be selected from the menu but can be selected with a remote control for DVD Players or can be selected with most software DVD players by right clicking or in the options..\n\nThere are some more srt subs.for other languages if you want to search the subtitle sites and then add them to the DVD.  It's not to hard but you have to learn. Some subs may be more difficult\n\n It's very easy to remove the subtitles you don't want.  Since this is already in DVD form using DVD Shrink just to unselect the subs you don't want without compressing or other editing is one of the easiest. but there are many other also that will do that. No re-encoding of the video will take place so it's fast.   \n\nThis was only my second DVD doing this so there may be a few small mistakes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aef794acb30a1a79bd7dc8382c40f40bb3d002c","amp;dn":"MULLIGANS+NTSC+DVD5+FULL+w+en+es+it+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aef794acb30a1a79bd7dc8382c40f40bb3d002c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,239,121,74,203,48,161,167,155,215,220,131,130,196,15,64,187,61,0,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
