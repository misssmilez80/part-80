You can compare any two snapshots and get the list of keys/data which are new, deleted or just changed. ARM can do comparing not only in the entire Registry, but also in any key of the Registry. It is also possible to exclude any keys of the Registry from compare results. Moreover, you can create undo/redo files (for example, to rollback the changes). To view the current state of a key, or to modify it, you can use Jump to Regedit function. Contents of any key can be exported to *.reg file.\nVery useful for detecting trojan viruses and elimination some problems caused by software and hardware install/uninstall.\nUnlike Registry monitoring software (such as RegMon and Win-Expose Registry), and most uninstallers (CleenSweep, Uninstall, etc.), ARM compares full copies of the Registry made at different times, while the software mentioned above just monitors all accesses to the Registry in real time. So, our method allows to track all the changes, and doesn't affect the system performance.\n\nHere is a brief list of ARM features: \n- Scan different copies Registry into a special file and browse/search them &quot;off-line&quot;\n- Scan the Registry on a remote computer\n- Compare different copies of the Registry\n- Compare individual branches of different copies of the Registry\n- Undo and Redo Registry changes based on comparison results: directly from the program or by generating the REG-files\n- Save any key of the Registry into the REG-file\n- And much more\n\nInstallation: \n1. Install the application.\n2. Copy the executable from crack folder into the installed directory and overwrite the existing .exe\n3. All limits will be removed.\n4. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f32ca745dd13ba3be9b6bc005ba7c670fe6f866d","amp;dn":"Active+Registry+Monitor+v1.38+%5BH33T%5D%5Bsuperl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f32ca745dd13ba3be9b6bc005ba7c670fe6f866d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,44,167,69,221,19,186,59,233,182,188,0,91,167,198,112,254,111,134,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
