The single peaked at number seven on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks and number sixteen on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nIn 2007, the song was also heavily edited and used as a new soundtrack for the California Screamin' ride at the Disneyland Resort, as part of their &quot;Rockin' Both Parks&quot; campaign.\n\nThe intro riff is very similar to Breadfan by Budgie.\n\nA music video was made for the song, directed by StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Sednaoui, who had previously made videos for other Chili Peppers songs such as &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot;, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Give It Away&quot;. The latter in particular, with its unique, chaotic visual style, is similar to &quot;Around the World&quot;; Sednaoui used similar visual techniques in the video for R.E.M.'s song &quot;Lotus&quot;. The video was featured on an episode of MTV's Making the Video.\n\nCalifornication is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on June 8, 1999 on Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, and introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.\n\nCalifornication produced several hits for the band, including &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot; and the Grammy AwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“winning &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;. Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. It is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide; a revitalization in comparison to their previous album, One Hot Minute. The record marked a change in style for the band; Rolling Stone's Greg Tate noted that &quot;while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e274ac720c574c06b670e216f74064c8f1956d03","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+Around+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e274ac720c574c06b670e216f74064c8f1956d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,116,172,114,12,87,76,6,182,112,226,22,247,64,100,200,241,149,109,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
