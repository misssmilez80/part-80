I have converted it to Mac OS using CXSkin Wrapper.\n\nRecWar can be played multiplayer. There are 3 options (and 1 single player):\n\n- You and your partner on 1 Mac.\n- Online\n- You and your partner on 1 Mac Online :P\n\nThere are 3 modes:\n\n- FFA - free for all - shoot everyone.\n- TDM - team deathmatch - you and your teammates kill enemies.\n- CTC - capture the cow - classic CTF. There is no limit to 2 teams ;) Max 11 \nteams!!!.\n\nYou can find in game files a map editor, but I didn't convert it to mac. But ofc, you can run everything on windows, make a map, and put it into mac game files.\n\nBut... Try it yourself ;) \n\nBlightwalker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e35e8b6592c2fc490f5a9d090f0fb3d963e1a5d8","amp;dn":"%5BGAME%5D+RecWar+for+Mac+-+CXSkin+Wrapper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e35e8b6592c2fc490f5a9d090f0fb3d963e1a5d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,94,139,101,146,194,252,73,15,90,157,9,15,15,179,217,99,225,165,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
