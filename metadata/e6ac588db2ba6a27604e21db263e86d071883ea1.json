Our strategy is to discuss the more fun topics at the start of the show, and gradually bring in the &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot; condemnation of humanity later on. This will give the casual listener ample warning about the heavier psychological &quot;Age 25+&quot; preachy and repetitive dialogue that is to come. We have found a better approach and folks who don't like &quot;preaching&quot; can drop away early. This week's show covers various concepts and current events as well as the need for a new &quot;middle class&quot; to emerge in our world. We think we all need to be more balanced people, and avoid the traditions of the master/slave economic feudal system altogether. We need a culture of balance and not one of greed, hedonism, and fun followed by the fire of wickedness and dire consequences. It will take time and effort but we'll end up with a better world.\n\nWe comment on the Bahai faith of universal worship, the Venus project.\nThe panic of the week the Michael Jackson case cant all that energy and resources devoted to his funeral be used in a more positive manner ??\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLA INKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the most disgusting show on tv and how the George Soros Gang is doing business as usual.\n2500 years the enlightened thinker Diogenes of Sinope was already aware of the same problems we are facing today is there not an honest soul anywhere out there ??\nIn the developers section we talk about the great free piece of software pdfcreator\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.honesty.org/paritytalk/downlo...24kbps.mp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.honesty.org/paritytalk/downlo...24kbps.mp3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nyou can find us at :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paritytalk.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paritytalk.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paritytalk.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paritytalk.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.honesty.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.honesty.org&lt;/a&gt;\nand of course our new forum http://www.paritycheck.org ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ac588db2ba6a27604e21db263e86d071883ea1","amp;dn":"Parity_Talk_July-05-2009__FIRE_FOLLOWS_FUN_24kbps.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ac588db2ba6a27604e21db263e86d071883ea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,172,88,141,178,186,106,39,96,78,33,219,38,62,134,208,113,136,62,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
