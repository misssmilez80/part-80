They can arrest you, shoot you.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d think it would be important to have a video record of their behavior.   But in the last few years -- in more than a dozen states -- citizens have been threatened, detained, or arrested after recording the police.\n\nIn this weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s FBN show (Thurs., 10pm EST), I ask Reason MagazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Radley Balko: What's happened to the people who were arrested for videotaping cops at work?  He explains that most people arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t actually prosecuted, but often their property is confiscated and they spend a night in jail.\n \n----------\nYou can support this independent effort to compile torrents about this show\nby volunteering bitcoin to:\n\n14prNxpuEgZwfKgjoy163zScawo7AiHuQk\n\nlearn: www.weusecoins.com\nsecurity discussion: www.grc.com/sn/sn-287.htm (halfway down page, or podcast)\n----------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:562fa21e20e501ae80a29a75f9c1525c227968c0","amp;dn":"20110421-Stossel-%5BPrivacy+vs.+Security%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"562fa21e20e501ae80a29a75f9c1525c227968c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,47,162,30,32,229,1,174,128,162,154,117,249,193,82,92,34,121,104,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
