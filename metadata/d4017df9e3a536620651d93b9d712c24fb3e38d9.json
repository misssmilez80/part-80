While they were away, Garbage popularized a sound that was remarkably similar to Curve's fusion of drum loops and shoegazing indie-pop. In light of Garbage's success, Curve has decided to delve deeper into dance, as Chinese Burn attests. Six of the eight tracks are mixes of the title track, all of which are quite different from each other, but not necessarily compelling. &quot;Chinese Burn&quot; itself is a strong comeback, a tight exciting rush of sound, but the other two tracks are standard-issue Curve. Still, the EP bodes well for the forthcoming full-length comeback. \n\n01 Chinese Burn (4:28)\n02 Chinese Burn [Paul Van Dyk Forbidden City Remix] (10:41)\n03 Chinese Burn [Lunatic Calm Remix] (7:38)\n04 Chinese Burn [Headcase Medipac Remix] (6:20)\n05 Chinese Burn [Witchman's Eye of the Storm Remix] (6:30)\n06 Chinese Burn [version] (4:54)\n07 Robbing Charity (6:01)\n08 Come Clean (2:16)\n\n-----\n\nFrom Cuckoo's Nest, The Curve Archive:\n\nCURVE. &quot;CHINESE BURN&quot;\n\nWritten by Toni Halliday / Dean Garcia\n\nProduced by Steve Osborne &amp; Curve, Mixed by Steve Osborne\n(except # Produced by Tim Simenon/Steve Osborne/Curve, Mixed by Flood/Tim Simenon)\n\nSteve Osborne appears courtesy of 140dB\n\npublished by EMI Music (BMI) / Anxious Music LTD / Songs of Polygram Inc.
