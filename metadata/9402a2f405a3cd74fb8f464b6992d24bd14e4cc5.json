Dr. Andersson made series of snuff films using his patients. The \n\nDoctor filmed all the murders in 8mm and started to call himself the Auteur.\n30 years later a small American film crew has arrived to Finland to shoot a horror \n\nmovie about the massacre. The movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s director, Steven, is engaged in his first \n\nfeature with his DoP Darius and gaffer Mike from LA. The leading actress is a \n\nFinnish rising star Lisa, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dreaming about Hollywood. Dr. Andersson is played \n\nby a famous B-movie actor with a big ego.\nEverything is going according to plan until two Finnish sound guys discover \n\nsomething evil hidden in the basement: the original snuff films shot by the Auteur.\nSteven is stimulated by the raw and brutal snuff film material and starts to rewrite the \n\nscript. The scenes are not real enough. Everything changes when he finds The \n\nAuteurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 8mm film camera. Now he is ready to shoot his masterpiece, the film for \n\nwhich he will be remembered.\nSoon the crew realizes that they are the stars of the film. Instead of making a horror \n\nfilm, they are in one. The Auteur is slaying the Skeleton Crew one by one. ThereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s no \n\nsequel for you!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9402a2f405a3cd74fb8f464b6992d24bd14e4cc5","amp;dn":"Skeleton.Crew%5BDVDSCR%5D-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9402a2f405a3cd74fb8f464b6992d24bd14e4cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,2,162,244,5,163,205,116,251,143,70,75,105,146,210,75,209,78,76,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
