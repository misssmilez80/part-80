It contains the original orchestral music composed by Leon Willett for the game, as well as several tracks by other musicians, including the game's lead sound designer Simon Poole and audio director Morten Sorlie. It was nominated in the &quot;Best Video Game Score&quot; category at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards but eventually lost to &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; score.\n\nAll songs by the Norwegian singer Magnet that have been included into the game were released on a the separate Magnet EP extended play CD released with the limited edition version of the game. &quot;Be With You&quot;, the only track composed specifically for the game, is heard on several occasions; in the lobby of Reza's apartment building, during Zoe's journeys to Japan and St. Petersburg, and during the closing credits. &quot;My Darling Curse&quot; plays when she takes a Vactrax to Newport, and &quot;Nothing Hurts Now&quot; is heard both when Zoe stays in Damien's apartment and in the very end, when she lies on her bed crying.\n\n\n\n\nNow you can download this fantastic game and play it on your Mac! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4987696/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4987696/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and keep seeding this one, bitchez!\n\n\nSincerely,\nOSOX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6d432eba4a0381170f66e7402f1ec656e8980d","amp;dn":"Leon+Willett+%26+Magnet+-+Dreamfall%3A+TLJ+OST+%26+EP+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6d432eba4a0381170f66e7402f1ec656e8980d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,109,67,46,186,74,3,129,23,15,102,231,64,47,30,198,86,232,152,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
