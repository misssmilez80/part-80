David Simpson talks with Alex about the Department of Justice threat to cancel airline flights to and from Texas in response to HB 1937, a bill Simpson filed to defend travelers' dignity against offensive and intrusive groping searches of private parts without probable cause by the TSA. HB 1937 passed unanimously out of committee and then again out of the Texas House and is backed by members of both parties in Texas. \n\nAlex welcomes to the show former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, who has criticized Obama for bombing Libya and killing civilians.\n\n\nToday's broadcast went 5 minutes into 4th hour overDrive to finish the conversation with Cynthia McKinney.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
