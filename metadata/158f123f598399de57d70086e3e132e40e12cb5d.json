Each episode follows one tank's story: the rebuild; the innovations that made each machine great, and the engineering flaws that proved fatal. Unique serial numbers lead us to re-trace each tank's forged-in-war history: discovering where it was made, the battles it fought and the often tragic end of its fighting career. Once the hard work is over, we see the machines sputter and roar to life.\n\nDirector : PJ Naworynski\nExecutive Producer for Military Channel : Peter Rees\nAn Ellis Vision Production with Viasat Explorer, UKTV, Canwest and Military Channel (2009)\n\nEpisode 3 : The M-24 Chaffee\nJoe Garbarino is CEO of a massive garbage and recycling business, but his true pride and joy is his own M-24 chaffee, the best light tank from WWII. Also, learn the story of Dien Bien Phu, when the French lost a battle and their empire in Indochina.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2133 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.792:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 48:52.080\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 854,833,152 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158f123f598399de57d70086e3e132e40e12cb5d","amp;dn":"Military.Channel.Tank.Overhaul.Series2.3of4.The.M-24.Chaffee.Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158f123f598399de57d70086e3e132e40e12cb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,143,18,63,89,131,153,222,87,215,0,134,227,225,50,228,14,18,203,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
