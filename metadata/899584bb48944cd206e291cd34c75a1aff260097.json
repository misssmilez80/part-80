Both he and the donkey would face certain execution.\n\nHowever the parish priest petitioned for the court to show mercy, unfortunately for Ferron the priest would only vouch for the good character of the animal. The donkey was spared and Ferron was burned alive.\n\nThroughout history donkeys, pigs, dogs, rats, even insects have been put on trial and some convicted and sentenced. Crime thriller writer and former solicitor Frances Fyfield looks at these extraordinary cases of animals in court.\n\nBBC World Service 2011 \n\nDuration    :  0:23:11\nBit Rate    :  64kbps\nChannels    :  1 (mono)\nSample Rate :  44KHz\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899584bb48944cd206e291cd34c75a1aff260097","amp;dn":"Animals+on+Trial+++%28BBC+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899584bb48944cd206e291cd34c75a1aff260097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,149,132,187,72,148,76,210,6,226,145,205,52,199,90,26,255,38,0,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
