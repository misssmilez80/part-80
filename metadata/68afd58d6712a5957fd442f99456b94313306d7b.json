Heavy, downtuned Sabbathian riffs, occasionally with sludgy vocals in the likes of Eyehategod/ Weedeater. The lengthy last track (18 minutes) really smoked my brain with instrumentals reminicient of the hypnotic driven OM vibe. Aside from the great influences, VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶lva crafted a really honest &amp; true sound. So go ahead &amp; check out what Iceland has to offer with this piece of gloomy doom, you won't be disappointed..\n-Stonerobixxx\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68afd58d6712a5957fd442f99456b94313306d7b","amp;dn":"Volva+-+Volva+%282010%29+Stoner+Doom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68afd58d6712a5957fd442f99456b94313306d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,175,213,141,103,18,165,149,127,212,66,249,148,86,185,67,19,48,109,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
