To this end, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an Army officer convinced he must save Germany from Hitler, is recruited to mastermind a real plan. To do so, he arranges for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie, to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. However, even as the plan is put into action, a combination of bad luck and human failings conspire on their own to create a tragedy that would prolong the greater one gripping Europe.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985699/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985699/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUser rating 7.4/10\n\nenjoy and seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c00bff804fb66114e706dc833f36a4b4f5c27893","amp;dn":"Valkyrie%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c00bff804fb66114e706dc833f36a4b4f5c27893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,11,255,128,79,182,97,20,231,6,220,131,63,54,164,180,245,194,120,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
