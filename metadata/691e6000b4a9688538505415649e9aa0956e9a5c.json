While Lew does not claim to be a \ndetective, he has developed a reputation for finding people.\n Two story arcs run through Vengeance. Fonesca finds himself \nsearching for the wife of a wealthy developer. She is rumored \nto have vanished for no reason but may have been involved with \nher psychiatrist. The other thread involves a runaway from Kansas\n whose mother has tracked her to Sarasota. The mother stops at the\n Dairy Queen and the owner recommends she contact Lew. The threads\n are each distinct and do not involve looking for the two people \nin the same places or the same way. Vengeance is the first book \nin Edgar award winner Stuart M. Kaminsky ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ s new series. Kaminsky \ndoes a wonderful job of gradually revealing information about Lew \nFonesca. He imparts just enough information at places where it\n makes sense. The background never feels forced in the story. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691e6000b4a9688538505415649e9aa0956e9a5c","amp;dn":"Stuart+Kaminsky+-+Vengeance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691e6000b4a9688538505415649e9aa0956e9a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,30,96,0,180,169,104,133,56,80,84,21,100,158,154,160,149,110,154,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
