Great sound quality, it suprising how good it is for a smaller arena. You will be impressed with the sound i assure you. It was an absolute stormer of a set, in my opinion even better than the show at wembley in 07 for anyone who was there too. Metallica were Supported by Machine Head and The sword. Anyone with audio or video footage of machine head's set i would be greatfull if you sent it me! &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;244941504548484d474549454051574c41566449574a0a474b49&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\nThe set consisted of:\n\n 1.

But metallica will be the top of that list till the day i die, this gig put em up there for me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d97ced325cf5a75f5513e9794dded05cbc6e40","amp;dn":"Metallica+Live+%40+Sheffield+UK+28%2F02%2F09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d97ced325cf5a75f5513e9794dded05cbc6e40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,217,124,237,50,92,245,167,95,85,19,233,121,77,222,208,92,188,110,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
