It scans local and network drives using a background\n       service and stores their structure, sizes and properties in an SQL\n          database. Linux and Unix filesystems can be scanned via SSH\n        (Secure Shell). In an Explorer-like user interface the collected\n        data can be viewed and browsed in hierarchical or tabular views,\n        3D bar, pie, line charts and tree maps. Using the archived data\n       you are able to track the development of the space usage from past\n          to present, and forecast future size usage. A flexible file\n         search, with predefined searches for very big, old or obsolete\n           files allows filtering and listing files directly from the\n              database. A duplicate file search is also included.\n         The SpaceObServer Remote Administration Client is a management\n        tool to configure scans, view scan results and generate exports\n               remotely from additional machines in your network.\n                       \n                    Use the following password when asked:\n                              4081-8309-4572-2744\n\n                                          \n                   NFO LAST UPDATED           \n                       06-11-2004              \n                         -----                  \n                 &lt;LNK/CPS&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77b0e97ae010236b5fba80043fe87cc1cdd510f9","amp;dn":"JAM.Software.SpaceObServer.v4.3.1.455.retail-FOSI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77b0e97ae010236b5fba80043fe87cc1cdd510f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,176,233,122,224,16,35,107,95,186,128,4,63,232,124,193,205,213,16,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
