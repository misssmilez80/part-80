It was released as a single on 15 January 2001, and appeared on the band's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five. The song was later included on Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger 1994-2000.\n\nThe song's lyrics are based on the band's feelings towards Australia's political position of the time. Musically, &quot;Like a Dog&quot; is strongly influenced by Ian Haug (guitar and backing vocals) and his love of Iggy Pop. &quot;Like a Dog&quot;'s video starred Anthony Mundine in a &quot;raging bull&quot; type sequence. Paul Williams - &quot;Rose Against the Odds&quot; also makes an appearance in video.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd2dfe7a276b54fbea2305650e85ca231192a2b","amp;dn":"Powderfinger+-+Like+A+Dog.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd2dfe7a276b54fbea2305650e85ca231192a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,210,223,231,162,118,181,79,190,162,48,86,80,232,92,162,49,25,42,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
