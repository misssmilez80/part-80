The extension of the glories of classical Greece to Egypt and Asia proceeded at a time of experimentation and variety. Part one surveys the principle actors of the Hellenistic world and their monarchies: Macedonia and Greece, Ptolemy's Egypt, and the Seleucid East and covers some minor states and the exotic Eastern border states. Part two surveys city-states in the Hellenistic era, and the attempts to forge a nascent federalism. Parts three and four combine to form the cultural half of the survey whith the new emphasis on the individual and reality, changing the scope of science, art, religion and philosophy and allowing the rise in the status of women.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f84cdd7c9594a41b569f0c9ef63074d615f622","amp;dn":"Michael+Grant+-+The+Hellenistic+World+%28html%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f84cdd7c9594a41b569f0c9ef63074d615f622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,248,76,221,124,149,148,164,27,86,159,12,158,246,48,116,214,21,246,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
