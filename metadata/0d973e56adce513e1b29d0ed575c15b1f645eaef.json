Lament for Lorien\n\nWuthering Heights is a Danish heavy metal band, with a somewhat eclectic musical style which falls in somewhere between progressive, folk, and power metal.\n\nWuthering Heights' musical style is relatively unique, combining various elements. Classic heavy metal and power metal along with the highly virtuosic speed metal style, are mixed with strong folk influences. Bagpipes, violins, flutes, and other traditional instruments are included in many songs. As is typical of power metal, the songs feature strong melodies and clean vocals. The band is often described as being progressive metal, though they are not strictly in-line with the genre. They are quite musically distinctive, with their closest musical neighbors probably being Falconer and Elvenking.\n\nFar From the Madding Crowd is their third full-length album. The title is taken from the novel by Thomas Hardy, Far from the Madding Crowd, though the subject matter of the songs themselves has little to do with the content of the novel, having more in common with the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nAll my uploads are ripped by me Abrasax\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d973e56adce513e1b29d0ed575c15b1f645eaef","amp;dn":"Wuthering+Heights+-+Far+From+the+Madding+Crowd+-Flac++-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d973e56adce513e1b29d0ed575c15b1f645eaef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,151,62,86,173,206,81,62,27,41,208,237,87,92,21,177,246,69,234,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
