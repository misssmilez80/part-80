While the Euro-version was a single disc that contained 19 tracks, the Japanese version contained a bonus disc comprised of ten rare live performances, all on par with Lizzy's classic 1978 in-concert set, Live and Dangerous. In fact, two of the tracks were planned to appear on the aforementioned set, but were dropped due to time constrictions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; and &quot;Opium Trail&quot; (both are must-hear, kick-ass versions). Featured on the live disc are renditions of &quot;Are You Ready,&quot; &quot;Chinatown,&quot; &quot;Killer on the Loose,&quot; &quot;Hollywood,&quot; &quot;Got to Give It Up,&quot; and &quot;Dear Miss Lonely Hearts&quot; (the latter originally being a Lynott solo composition), among others. The best-of disc contains all the expected Lizzy faves, such as &quot;Jailbreak,&quot; &quot;Whisky in the Jar,&quot; &quot;Waiting for an Alibi,&quot; &quot;Still in Love With You,&quot; and more, but surprisingly, the song that the album is titled after is not included (which originally appeared on 1975's Fighting).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a444736a7065fae8880e4085fca798b25e11968a","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy-Wild+One+%28Best+Of%29+%28mp3+320+kb%2Fs%29+%5Btntvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a444736a7065fae8880e4085fca798b25e11968a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,68,115,106,112,101,250,232,136,14,64,133,252,167,152,178,94,17,150,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
