Normally, the player, as either Chell in the single-player campaign or as one of two robots, Atlas or P-body, in the co-operative campaign, can move, look, and carry and drop objects. The goal is to maneuver the characters through a number of test chambers in the Aperture Science facility, traversing the chamber from the start to the exit. Though the player-character can take some damage for a brief period of time, they will die under sustained injury and be restarted at a recent checkpoint; however, characters are equipped with &quot;long fall boots&quot; that absorb the shock of landing after a large vertical drop. The player must figure out how to overcome seemingly-bottomless gaps, evade pools of toxic liquid, or avoid line-of-sight or even disable robotic turrets to safely arrive at the exit.\n\nMore Information from Wikipedia URL &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76d7c22884cdd581e858677b0aa857c03baeed7b","amp;dn":"Portal+2+%5BSpyShadow%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76d7c22884cdd581e858677b0aa857c03baeed7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,215,194,40,132,205,213,129,232,88,103,123,10,168,87,192,59,174,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
