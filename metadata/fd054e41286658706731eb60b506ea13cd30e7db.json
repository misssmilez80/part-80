It was released on October 21, 2008 in North America and on October 23, 2008 in Europe and Australia. Crytek, the developers of the original game, were not involved in the development of Far Cry 2.\n\nUbisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, though the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a fictional modern-day East African nation in a state of anarchy and civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate &quot;The Jackal,&quot; a notorious arms dealer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd054e41286658706731eb60b506ea13cd30e7db","amp;dn":"Far_Cry_2-Tomitian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd054e41286658706731eb60b506ea13cd30e7db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,5,78,65,40,102,88,112,103,49,235,96,181,6,234,19,205,48,231,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
