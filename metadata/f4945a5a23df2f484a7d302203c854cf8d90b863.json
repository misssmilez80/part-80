Leslie Woodhead first met the Beatles in 1962 when he worked on a film in the Liverpool Cavern Club before the world had heard of the Fab Four. Twenty-five years later, when Woodhead began to make films in the Soviet Union, he became aware of how the Beatles legend had soaked into the lives of a generation of Soviet kids -- even though they were barred from playing &quot;Back in the USSR.&quot;\n\nNow he has been on a journey to meet the Soviet Beatles generation and to discover how the Fab Four changed their lives. Featuring a bizarre collection of Beatles tribute bands, the film tracks down the stories of how the Cold War was won with music as much as with nuclear missiles.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 55mn 27s 864ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English/Russian\nSubtitles         : English Hardcoded\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 035 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4945a5a23df2f484a7d302203c854cf8d90b863","amp;dn":"PBS-How+The+Beatles+Rocked+The+Kremlin+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4945a5a23df2f484a7d302203c854cf8d90b863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,148,90,90,35,223,47,72,74,125,48,34,3,200,84,207,141,144,184,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
