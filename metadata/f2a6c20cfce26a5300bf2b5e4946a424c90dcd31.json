On the film is a lone man, concealing a rifle, standing on a grassy knoll - the exact knoll President John F. Kennedy passed as he was assassinated. But is the film authentic? Or, is it another hoax surrounding President Kennedy's murder? When David seeks help in Professor Steve Lynde (Chris Noth, Sex and the City), it becomes horrifically clear the photo holds evidence of \nconspiracy. Now, the two must race to expose the cover-up before they're eliminated. \n\nVideo Codec.......: XviD-1.2.1\nVideo Bitrate.....: 904 kbps\nAudio Codec.......: AC3 stereo\nAudio Bitrate.....: 192 kbps\nAspect Ratio......: 1.81:1\nResolution........: 640 x 352\nFrame Rate........: 23.976 fps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a6c20cfce26a5300bf2b5e4946a424c90dcd31","amp;dn":"Frame_Of_Mind_%282009%29.VoMiT.ShareReactor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a6c20cfce26a5300bf2b5e4946a424c90dcd31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,166,194,12,252,226,106,83,0,191,43,94,73,70,164,36,201,13,205,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
