A tragic accident. Now, five friends must confront the past, themselves and a shocking secret.\n\nI came across this film when doing a bit of research on IMDB. I enjoyed the acting and character development. Although this genre has been done many times, this particular one stood out for me as it struck a personal nerve. On one particular level, I can relate to what the characters in this film are dealing with. I lost a few good friends during my High School years. At each of my High School reunions since, our dead friends become a topic of deep discussion and reflection.\n\nThere is a good chance you'll enjoy this film on one level or another.\n\n\nXviD Avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb22d38901850ddd05036231c35fa487acb40cf","amp;dn":"Jacklight+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb22d38901850ddd05036231c35fa487acb40cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,178,45,56,144,24,80,221,208,80,54,35,28,53,250,72,122,203,64,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
