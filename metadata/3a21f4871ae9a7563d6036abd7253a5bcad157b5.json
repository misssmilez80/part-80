The 3.X versions with their license keys will not work for a 4.X release.  This APK is of course the full release, but doesn't utilize an external key.  I'm not sure if you can update it since when I tried to, it said the package wasn't signed correctly.  I tried it twice and got the same message.  So, I'm not sure if this is a legit ROM or a cracked version.  Either way, it still works and is much better than the 3.X versions out there that you can't even update to a 4.X release without getting the freeware version.\n\nNOTE:  I'll seed this for a few days on and off, but if someone is in the middle of a download, I won't stop seeding until they finish.  After that, I seriously hope someone started seeding.  If not, just post a comment on here and I'll help you out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a21f4871ae9a7563d6036abd7253a5bcad157b5","amp;dn":"ROM+Manager+4.2.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a21f4871ae9a7563d6036abd7253a5bcad157b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,33,244,135,26,233,167,86,61,96,54,171,215,37,58,91,202,209,87,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
