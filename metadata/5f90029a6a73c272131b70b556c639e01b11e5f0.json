The story begins on Christmas Eve, when the hit-man enters a church to confess his sins to the priest. Through a series of gripping flashbacks, the ConfessorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey is revealed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ laying out what has brought him to this moment and leading the audience to the dramatic ending where the man's chances at ultimate redemption hang in the balance. While at first the Confessor seems to be an evil, cold-blooded killing machine and the Priest the ultimate arbiter of good, as the series develops it becomes clear that both characters are much more complicated than either could have suspected.\n\n---\n\nThe Confession: Chapter 10\nSeason 1 : Ep. 10 (06:37)\n\nAir date: 05/03/2011 \n\n\nThe Confessor reveals his intentions.\n\n---\n\nFile\nThe Confession - 2011 - 720x400/The Confession - S01E10 - 720 x 400.avi\nStorlek\n20711 kB (20 MB)\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngd\n00:06:37\nDemuxer\navi\n\nKlippinfo\nMjukvara\nLavf52.106.0\n\nVideo\nUpplÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sning\n720 x 400\nBildformat\n1.7778\nFormat\nXVID\nBitar/sek\n285 kbps\nBildrutor/sekund\n23.976\nVald codec\nffodivx\n\nInitialljudstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m\nFormat\n85\nBitar/sek\n128 kbps\nFrekvens\n48000 Hz\nKanaler\n2\nVald codec\nffmp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f90029a6a73c272131b70b556c639e01b11e5f0","amp;dn":"The+Confession+-+S01E10+-+720+x+400.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f90029a6a73c272131b70b556c639e01b11e5f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,144,2,154,106,115,194,114,19,27,112,181,86,198,57,224,27,17,229,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
