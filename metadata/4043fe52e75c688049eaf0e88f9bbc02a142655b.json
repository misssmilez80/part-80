You can choose from a score of great graphical transitions between your slides, or have random transitions for every slide. You can add multiple background music or other audio tracks and have the length of the slideshow automatically match the length of your music.\n\nSlideshow Editor\nThe Slideshow Editor has an intuitive timeline that shows the entire slideshow sequence graphically. You get a live preview and can edit components on the timeline with Drag &amp; Drop.
