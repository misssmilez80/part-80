This man is Dr Georgi Lulchev, a psychiatrist, neurologist, Chinese medicine man, administrator, amateur chef, entrepreneur and Director of the Home for Psychologically Disabled Men. His dream is to organise a farm in the yard of the home, where the patients can raise snails, ostriches and pheasants, produce silk fibres and soybean food. This is a story full of optimism, snails, ostriches, silk, charity, the Eastern Orthodox Church, soybean food, schizophrenics, oligophrenics, psychopaths, Korean investors, Western hunters, misery, acupuncture and compassion. Compassion, business, butterflies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b7ca59e74b5bbf997a7c48438f59820b97e15c","amp;dn":"Georgi+and+the+butterflies+%28english+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b7ca59e74b5bbf997a7c48438f59820b97e15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,183,202,89,231,75,91,191,153,122,124,72,67,143,89,130,11,151,225,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
