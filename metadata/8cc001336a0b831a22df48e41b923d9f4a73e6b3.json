Imaginary Fights                                     3:50\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nBlue Roses, the pseudonym Laura Groves chose to represent the\nramshackle group of musicians that play on this, her debut, is\nan odd choice when you consider that actual blue roses can\nonly be made by artificial means.\n\nNo actual blue rose exists in nature at all and to create one\nyou need to use genetic engineering and all sorts of modern\ntechnology. It's odd then that Blue Roses the album sounds\nseemingly untouched by anything approaching modern\nexperimentation, with delicate instrumentation (mainly\nacoustic) and fragile melodies creeping slowly out of the\nspeakers.\n\nIn a music industry where background and context are poured\nover as much as the music itself, it's worth noting that Blue\nRoses appear unencumbered by tales of, for example, recording\nin the woods for months following the demise of a\nrelationship, nor do they emerge blinking in the light of\nunimaginable hype. Rather, the tale is simple; bored\nsongwriter from Yorkshire borrows guitar, writes some songs,\nropes in some friends to help and records in kitchens,\nbedrooms and bathrooms across the north.\n\nSuch a simple and relaxed gestation is obvious throughout the\n10 songs. Opener Greatest Thoughts is a delicate piano-lead\ntale of being left alone, its undulating tempo and melody\nreminiscent of Joanna Newsom at her most wordy. Like Newsom,\nGroves has a voice that seems to sweep from hushed and\ntouching to high-pitched and almost shrill at the drop of a\nhat.\n\nIn the main she uses it to wonderful effect, creating\nswirling, almost operatic backing vocals on Cover Your Tracks\nand when the choir of voices arrives in highlight Does Anyone\nLove Me Now? it's simply beautiful. Only on a few occasions\ndoes the voice grate and at the beginning of Cover Your Tracks\nshe sounds not unlike a young Aled Jones limbering up for\nanother crack at The Snowman theme, Walking In The Air.\n\nMusically the album centres on the acoustic guitar, but there\nare numerous embellishments that arrive as unexpectedly as a\nwarm breeze. I Am Leaving features shuffling percussion,\nfingerpicked guitar and, surprisingly, a fuzzed-up keyboard\nriff that coalesces with a multi-tracked choir of background\nsingers. Debut single Doubtful Comforts is built solely around\na kalimba, a kind of thumb piano, whilst the PJ Harvey-esque\nRebecca strips away the excess to reveal a crudely played\nelectric guitar and a relentless bass drum.\n\nBlue Roses is a startling debut, a record that oozes warmth\nand charm whilst revealing itself slowly and patiently. It's\nthe kind of album that you'll want to recommend and that suits\na word-of-mouth popularity. It's a hushed secret or a haunting\npresence, not something that sings its own praises or gives a\nknowing wink every time an obvious influence flashes by. It\nmay not be an album that expects to be sat near the top of\nlists come the year's end, but Laura Groves and Blue Roses\nneed to be prepared for that eventuality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc001336a0b831a22df48e41b923d9f4a73e6b3","amp;dn":"Blue+Roses+-+Blue+Roses+-+2009+-+DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc001336a0b831a22df48e41b923d9f4a73e6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,192,1,51,106,11,131,26,34,223,72,228,27,146,61,159,74,115,230,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
