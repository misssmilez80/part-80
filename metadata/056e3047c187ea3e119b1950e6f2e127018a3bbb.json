The passion and feeling of the guitar duo got the capacity crowd on their feet. In 1998, Santana invited again Vargas to play in his concerts in Madrid and Paris (Bercy). This experience was repeated in Spain, where Vargas played as a guest of Carlos Santana in his opening tour of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSupernaturalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 2000 .

The sixth album, Feedback/ Bluestrology (1998) was recorded at Hook End studios in Checkendom (England), and co-produced by Ian Taylor (Gary Moore, Cheaptrick producer etc).

Chill Latin Blues, Vargas Blues band first solely instrumental album, was released in 2003.

He has a positive, fruitful and brilliant future ahead. There are very few musicians who can reach out to everybody...&quot; The album includes five songs already recorded in other albums together with nine brand new songs. In September 2004, Javier Vargas flew back to Memphis with a new project ready to be recorded. The chosen studio was Ardent, sound engineer John Hampton, and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA-TeamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Tennessee musicians: Steve Potts on drums, David Smith playing bass, Earnest Williamson ..boards, and the SRV..s Double Trouble..s Reese Wynans performing ..boards and piano as the master he is.
