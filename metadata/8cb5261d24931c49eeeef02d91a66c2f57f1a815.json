His guitar graced some 20 albums, like John Cale's Fear, Eno's Here \nCome the Warm Jets, and Nico's The End. This outing from his all-star side \ngroup is slicker than his 1976 live debut album, but no less worthwhile; some \n16 musicians are credited. The sound is sleek and sophisticated; even lyrics \naren't exempt from creative twists, as shown on &quot;Listen Now&quot;'s glistening \njazz-pop -- which cleverly juxtaposes its title against a bouncy &quot;now, now, \nlisten&quot; chorus. The song also questions how people are living life in a \nrepressive society, even as &quot;Law and Order&quot; and &quot;City of Lights&quot; ponder its \nbreakdown. Other songs visit more personal turf. &quot;Flight 19&quot; details a young \nman's angst-filled reaction to his lover's injuries, &quot;Postcard Love&quot; dismisses \nthe perils of on-road romances, and &quot;That Falling Feeling&quot; takes a more \nwistful look at how people grow apart -- over a gliding Manzanera guitar part. \n(Yet another sly twist shifts the chorus from &quot;Can't you feel it moving in?&quot; to \n&quot;You can feel it moving in.&quot;) Three totally different instrumentals round out \nmatters. The best one is the lilting &quot;Island,&quot; anchored by a climbing Bill \nMcCormick bassline, as Manzanera unleashes his full array of guitar-altering \ndevices. &quot;Initial Speed&quot; and &quot;Que?&quot; take more of a jazz/fusion tack; they're \ndifferent snapshots of Manzanera's graceful, intelligent guitar style. This \nalbum's one of the most absorbing entries of Manzanera's lengthy career. ~ \nRalph Heibutzki, All Music Guide\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Phil Manzanera - guitar, acoustic piano, Hammond organ\n    * Eno - guitar treatment, chorus piano, synthesizer\n    * Simon Ainley - lead vocals\n    * Bill MacCormick - bass, vocals\n    * Ian MacCormick - vocals\n    * Tim Finn - vocals\n    * Kevin Godley - vocals, percussion\n    * Lol Creme - vocals\n    * Billy Livsey - clarinet, Wurlitzer piano, Fender Rhodes\n    * Mel Collins - soprano saxophone\n    * John White - tuba\n    * Eddie Jobson - acoustic piano, Fender piano\n    * Eddie Rayner - acoustic piano\n    * Francis Monkman - Fender Rhodes, synthesizer\n    * Rhett Davies - Hammond organ\n    * Simon Phillips - drums, percussion\n    * Dave Mattacks - drums\n    * Alan Lee - background vocals\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cb5261d24931c49eeeef02d91a66c2f57f1a815","amp;dn":"Phil+Manzanera+-+Listen+Now%21%21+%281977%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cb5261d24931c49eeeef02d91a66c2f57f1a815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,181,38,29,36,147,28,73,238,238,240,45,145,166,108,47,87,241,168,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
