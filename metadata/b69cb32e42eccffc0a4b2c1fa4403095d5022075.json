The DMZedge works as a communication proxy,    \n    replacing unsecure inbound connections from the Internet to your   \n    internal network.                                                  \n                                                                       \n    The DMZedge Server works as a proxy between users on the Internet  \n    and your secure corporate LAN. DMZedge Server resides in the       \n    Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - outside of your corporate firewall.     \n    The GroupDrive or Titan MFT Server that resides on your network    \n    initiates a session with the DMZedge through a secure outbound     \n    connection. All incoming client requests and data are forwarded    \n    to the back-end server through a connection that has already been  \n    established between the MFT Server and the DMZedge Server. The     \n    MFT or GroupDrive Servers reside securely behind your corporate    \n    firewall, although ease of access for your end users is as simple  \n    as if the servers were in your DMZ. Data storage and               \n    authentication take place on the back-end server, and no inbound   \n    ports are opened through your firewall.                            \n                                                                       \n    Features...                                                        \n                                                                       \n    - No requirement for opening inbound ports through your corporate  \n      firewall; instead the internal MFT or GroupDrive Server          \n      initiates an outbound connection to the DMZedge Server           \n    - Enables Managed File Transfers and secure collaboration by       \n      working in conjunction with either the Titan MFT or GroupDrive   \n      Server products                                                  \n    - Virtual authentication - DMZedge acts as a proxy for             \n      authentication to the back-end server, including authentication  \n      to existing Active Directory or LDAP server implementations      \n    - Secure protocol support including full FTPS, SFTP, HTTPS, and    \n      WebDAV over SSL                                                  \n    - Complete pass-through capability - no storage or replication of  \n      user database information is required on the DMZedge Server      \n    - Simple, wizard-driven installation reduces implementation time.  \n                                                                       \n    Changes in 3.01.507                                                \n                                                                       \n    - Fixed: Port in use error when a MFT server conected and          \n      disconnected and reconnected to the DMZ server.                  \n    - Added: FIPS-140-2 Compliance when used with Titan MFT Server v7  \n      and SFTP.                                                        \n    - Added: DMZedge Server is now available in a full 64-bit edition  \n      for installation under the 64-bit editions of Windows Server     \n      2003 and Windows Server 2008.                                    \n    -
