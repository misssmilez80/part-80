On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note: &quot;I know what you did last summer.&quot; The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max (Johnny Galecki), but then Max is murdered -- and the terror begins. (In the original Lois Duncan novel, the teens hit a small boy on a bicycle instead of a fisherman.) The screenplay is by Kevin Williamson, whose credits include the 1996 box-office hit Scream.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 41 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bde8ff3e6f4f35807d356d30629208949ff5fa","amp;dn":"I+Know+What+You+Did+Last+Summer%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bde8ff3e6f4f35807d356d30629208949ff5fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,189,232,255,62,111,79,53,128,125,53,109,48,98,146,8,148,159,245,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
