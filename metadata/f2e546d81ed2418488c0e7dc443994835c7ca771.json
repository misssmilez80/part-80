For exemple, I made a powerpoint presentation with a hyperlink to a *.mpg movie, but every time i got the message that there was no program associated with the mpg file. (just a side note: My standard player for everything is VLC) I had two choices, either switch back to lame old windows media player, or fix the problem. So I fixed it =P\n\nThe program adds some keys to your register, so all MS office applications know that VLC is the boss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2e546d81ed2418488c0e7dc443994835c7ca771","amp;dn":"vlc+fix+1.0.3.00.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2e546d81ed2418488c0e7dc443994835c7ca771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,229,70,216,30,210,65,132,136,192,231,220,68,57,148,131,92,124,167,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
