The basic gameplay clones that of Elasto Mania, but the simulated physics are subtly different. The project was started in 2005. [1]\n\nIn X-Moto, a player selects a level and tries to collect the strawberries. Strawberries are required to complete a level, along with touching a flower.[2] Obstacles to this goal are challenging terrain features and &quot;wrecker&quot; objects which should not be touched; in most levels there are no moving objects (only scripted or physics levels may have them). Also, these can be changed in some levels. The driver is not harmed directly by falling, only by hitting his head on rock or hitting any part of his body or the bike on a wrecker object. If this happens the level is lost (as of version 0.5.3 levels can feature check points). It is possible to save a replay, and to show a previous replay (&quot;ghost driver&quot;) in parallel to gameplay.\n\nThe game is extensible with over 2500 user-created custom levels that can be automatically downloaded.[2] These are created using Inkscape with the Inksmoto extension.
