Most peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reaction is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat kind of name is that \nfor a band?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Actually, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just one example of how different \nand complex the Kansas City, Missouri based band can be. When trying to \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiscoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a name for the band in mid 2005, the first bass player John Foster \nspoke up and replied ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow About The Truth?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s when the band realized \nthat the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was not only a good name for the band, but is what \neveryone really wants, not deception or lies. This became the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nphilosophy in dealing with their music as well as pertaining to their personal \nlives as well.\n\nHow About The Truth consists of Ricky Horney (25) from Camden Point, \nMissouri on Lead Vocals &amp; Didgeridoo, Pat Kelley (19) Kansas City, Missouri \nplaying Lead Guitar, Bryant Bridges (20) Smithville, Missouri on Vocals, Piano, \nand Rhythm Guitar, Ricky Sands (19) Agency, Missouri on Bass, with Matt \nDavis (19) Kansas City, Missouri playing Drums and Percussion.\n\nWhen asked to describe the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical style, that can difficult at times. \nThe reason being, HattÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music cannot easily be put into a certain genre \nbecause the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style is an ongoing work in progress. The band is always \nopen to new ideas with one example being, the use of the Aborigine \nDidgeridoo used in the intros on some of their songs. Melodic at its core, the \nband agrees its music has gotten heavier in the last several years. The \nclosest industry classification would probably be Progressive/Alternative Rock \nwith a Post-Grunge influence.\n\nHow About The Truth writes and composes all of its own songs and music. \nThree independent CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s have been released. Around The Table, Eleven To \nElm, and Redefine (EP). The Redefine (EP) was recorded, mixed, and \nmastered at Chapman Recording Studio of Lenexa, Kansas.\n\n&quot;Eleven to Elm&quot; lineup is Bryant Bridges - Lead Vocals, Guitar, and Synth, \nPatrick Kelley - Guitars, Matt Davis - Drums/Percussion, and Ricky Sands - \nBass and Backing Vocals.\n\nFor more info visit:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad8d01252b1479933f0b129a5214d88f9a8a4113","amp;dn":"How+About+The+Truth%3F+-+Eleven+to+Elm+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad8d01252b1479933f0b129a5214d88f9a8a4113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,141,1,37,43,20,121,147,63,11,18,154,82,20,216,143,154,138,65,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
