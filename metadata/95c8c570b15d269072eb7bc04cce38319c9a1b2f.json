As I indicate in the comments, these are burn tested ONLY on a Samsung  C6500. So far no one has complained about the ISO not working. Some of my future uploads will be DVD-9 for the simple reason that when I tried to make a DVD-5 it reported that the quality would only be average.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnjoy and please share.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**********************************************************************************\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI have been trying to duplicate HD-R-US format iso's and I believe that this is like their uploads. It was made with a program called BDtoAVCHD.  It was compressed with X264 in a 2 pass encode on  a Quad core processor and 4GB of memory. The process is completely automatic , you just pick the size you want the final file to be. I then used IMG burn to burn to DVD and tested it on a Samsung C6500 BR player. It reacted the same as HD-R-US discs and started playing after insertion. There is no menu. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t***********************************************************************************\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                 Here is the info for burning from an old HD-R-US post.     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t***********************************************************************************\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                              I M P O R T A N T   I N F O R M A T I O N\n\nBy using ImgBurn and selecting &quot;Write image file to disc&quot;, this iso can be burnt straight to a DVD5 disc to be played back on any stand-alone, AVCHD compatible, Blu-ray or DVD-HD player, including PS3. Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to stream the movie or watch it on your computer, Daemon Tools virtual drive can be used to mount the image file, or PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to extract the files and folders from the iso. This is a blu-ray/AVCHD iso, not a DVD iso, so applications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise it. The movie file itself will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named &quot;00000.m2ts&quot;. Once extracted, if you decide to save the movie by burning it onto a DVD5 disc, your ImgBurn settings need to be as follows:-\n\nClick &quot;Write files/folders to disc&quot;\nAdd both the BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders\nSelect the Options Tab-\nData Type = MODE1/2048\nFile System = UDF\nUDF Revision = 2.50\nMake sure that the &quot;Recurse Subdirectories&quot; field IS checked, and all other fields are NOT checked.\nInsert your DVD5 disc and click Burn.\n\nThe relevant codecs need to be installed to watch any HD movie on your computer. K-Lite's codec pack is free to download, but there are numerous others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c8c570b15d269072eb7bc04cce38319c9a1b2f","amp;dn":"JUSTIN+BIEBER+NEVER+SAY+NEVER+2011_BLURAY+X264_AVCHD_TTL.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c8c570b15d269072eb7bc04cce38319c9a1b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,200,197,112,177,93,38,144,114,235,123,192,76,206,56,49,156,154,27,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
