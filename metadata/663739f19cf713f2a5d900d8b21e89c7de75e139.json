Recently, however, public opinion has been shifting back to the strongly hostile view of usury held by humanity for millennia before the rise of capitalism. This book examines the ways in which usury was perceived and portrayed at the very beginning of its rise to power. David Hawkes examines early modern English depictions of usury in a wide variety of literary media: plays, pamphlets, poems, political economy, and parliamentary debates. It suggests that knowledge of such portrayals may help us settle accounts with the vastly expanded form taken by usury in our own time.\n\nReview\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHawkes' brilliant anatomy of early modern usury illuminates a keyword of the period.  Revealing usury's connections to magic and witchcraft, sodomy, idolatry, unnatural birth, epicurean self-indulgence, consumer desire, and the death of hospitality, Hawkes argues that early modern people saw usury as unambiguously evil. The Culture of Usury in Renaissance England evokes a world in which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“making money breedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was assumed to destroy the soul and the possibility for just and charitable action. Learned, impassioned, and forcefully written, Hawkes' book uses the past to query many of the assumptions that govern contemporary life. A tour de force.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jean Howard, George Delacorte Professor in the Humanities, Columbia University and Chair of the Department of English and Comparative Literature","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:663739f19cf713f2a5d900d8b21e89c7de75e139","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+The+culture+of+usury+in+Renaissance+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"663739f19cf713f2a5d900d8b21e89c7de75e139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,55,57,241,156,247,19,242,165,217,0,216,178,30,137,199,222,117,225,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
