I was pretty annoyed too, so I decided to cut it into individual tracks, each track representing an individual movement. \n\nThe aim was to ensure each track sounded like a truly unique song, and I think I've achieved that. Really, I did this since there are some movements I like more than others, and I really wanted to be able to shuffle this album. \n\nI also created a lossless audio counterpart to this; if there's enough demand, I might seed them as well, but right now I will just seed the MP3's. \n\n\nTools used: Audacity (digital audio editor); Mp3tag (audio file tag editor).\n\nMP3's encoded with LAME @ 320kbps CBR, Joint Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e70f2fc2168958f3443777df74c32fb31167b3","amp;dn":"Echochrome+II+-+a+Soundtrack+%28in+13+parts%29+-%5BMP3-320%5D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e70f2fc2168958f3443777df74c32fb31167b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,231,15,47,194,22,137,88,243,68,55,119,223,116,195,47,179,17,103,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
