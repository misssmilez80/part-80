This is real punk, the way you remember it being before it got watered down!\n\n1 A Home If Nuts\n2 Him + A Fetus = No\n3 So I Hunt Fame\n4 Humanifesto\n5 Unsafe To Him\n6 Some Thai Fun\n7 Oh! Meat Is Fun\n8 A Menu Of Shit\n9 Atheism Of UN\n10 Safe In Mouth\n11 South Famine\n\nThe songs here are demos for the second album by Montreal punk band Humanifesto, entitled &quot;The Infamous&quot;. The band decided that they could get a much better recording done at a different studio, so these Red Rhino Studio recordings will simply serve as the demos for the album.\n\nEnjoy! The real release will be out in early 2010.\n\nSupport independent music and spread the word about this band!\n\nShare and enjoy!\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7746daee01af86df560dd4826dd54eae2038a35e","amp;dn":"Humanifesto+-+The+Infamous+Demos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7746daee01af86df560dd4826dd54eae2038a35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,70,218,238,1,175,134,223,86,13,212,130,109,213,78,174,32,56,163,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
