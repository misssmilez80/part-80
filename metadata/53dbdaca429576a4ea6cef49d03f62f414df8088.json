Of course, most of the time, something weird usually happens including aliens planting a chip in Cartman's anus and Michael Jackson moves into the neighborhood. Other wild adventures include: the boys blaming their parents for child molestation and Cartman feeding Scott Tenorman his parents in chili. A movie was given in the early seasons in 1999. And the boys enjoy their Terrence &amp; Philip, a Canadian comedy duo (which the parents were against in the movie)\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121955/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121955/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53dbdaca429576a4ea6cef49d03f62f414df8088","amp;dn":"south+park+season+13+%28eps-1-7%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53dbdaca429576a4ea6cef49d03f62f414df8088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,219,218,202,66,149,118,164,234,108,239,73,208,63,98,244,20,223,128,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
