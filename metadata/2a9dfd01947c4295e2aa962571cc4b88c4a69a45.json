SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seventeen, bright, beautiful and seriously rebellious, full of sarcastic wit that barely disguises the hurt inside. Pushed aside by her mother, Karen, who is on her third marriage and counting, Greta is shipped off to her grandparents for the summer, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not happy about it.
