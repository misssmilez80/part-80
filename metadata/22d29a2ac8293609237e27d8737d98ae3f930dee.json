I bought the DVD several months ago because I couldn't find a torrent, so I'm filling that gap.\n\nThe film is useful for Lost Odyssey fans, or more specifically Jansen Friedh fans. The star is Michael McGaham, the voice of Jansen, in one his few roles. Such a shame...\n\nAnyway, it's a pretty hiliarious flick, and has that low budget Troma charm we've come to love and expect.\n\n\nPlease seed when done! Spread the love!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d29a2ac8293609237e27d8737d98ae3f930dee","amp;dn":"Blondes+Have+More+Guns.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d29a2ac8293609237e27d8737d98ae3f930dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,210,154,42,200,41,54,9,35,126,39,216,115,125,152,174,63,147,13,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
