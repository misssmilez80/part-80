Ordinary men, women &amp; children, from all walks of life, in all sorts of circumstances and each one with a unique story to tell. This is the ChurchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and this is HillsongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 18th Live praise and worship album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“faith+hope+loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. EveryONE together playing their part and lending their voice to the collective story, OUR story. Recorded LIVE in March 2009, over 3 weekends and locations, the people of Hillsong Church gathered across our city - in their respective campuses - and then united together as ONE in celebration of an ever good and gracious God. Led by the Hillsong worship team including Hillsong UNITED, Darlene Zschech &amp; Reuben Morgan, this album features 13 songs of FAITH in the midst of personal circumstances, HOPE in Jesus for the future, and LOVE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one for another. The prayer is that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Faith+Hope+Love' will breathe the light, love and freedom of Christ into your life, and continue to give expression to what God is doing in and through PEOPLE all over the Earth.&quot;\n\nRelease date third quarter 09\n\n\nTrack Listing\n/01 The First And The Last.mp3    11.49 MiB\n/02 For Your Name.mp3              8.99 MiB\n/03 Glow.mp3                      11.35 MiB\n/04 It's Your Love.mp3            19.57 MiB\n/05 I Will Exalt You.mp3          17.63 MiB\n/06 Yahweh.mp3                    16.69 MiB\n/07 No Reason To Hide.mp3          8.52 MiB\n/08 God One And Only.mp3           8.02 MiB\n/09 The Wonder Of Your Love.mp3   11.37 MiB\n/10 His Glory Appears.mp3          7.63 MiB\n/11 We The Redeemed.mp3           17.22 MiB\n/12 We Will See Him.mp3           15.32 MiB\n/13 You Hold Me Now.mp3           18.94 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13891eda6eb20389b61b6f20525196bb4fcdb06","amp;dn":"Faith+%2B+Hope+%2B+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13891eda6eb20389b61b6f20525196bb4fcdb06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,56,145,237,166,235,32,56,155,97,182,242,5,37,25,107,180,252,219,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
