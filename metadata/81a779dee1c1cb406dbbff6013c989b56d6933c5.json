PcBoost takes advantage of this by allocating more CPU power to the currently active program/game. All of this is done automatically without having you to lift one finger.\n\nPcBoost is a great affordable alternative to purchasing a new computer and can in no way harm or destroy a computer, while providing equivalent power that a faster processor would.\n\nPcBoost is quite easy to use and understand. With a few button pushes and setting changes the application is ready to work.\n\nPcBoost starts up automatically when Windows does and manages the CPU/Processor according to the user's specifications.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;PCBoost&quot;:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Optimizes games and applications by increasing the CPU priority thread of the currently active application.\nAutomatically de-allocates CPU priority when a new active application is selected.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Works in the background to optimize applications constantly, raises priority levels to reasonable values to\nmaintain system stability.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Visual representation in system tray which displays priority optimization for currently active application.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Built-in block list of applications which are not compatible, to prevent problems with the software such as slow\ndowns or computer crashes.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Easy and intuitive user interface which performs CPU tuning in real-time.\n\nHome Page - http://www.pgware.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a779dee1c1cb406dbbff6013c989b56d6933c5","amp;dn":"PGWARE+PCBoost+4.5.16.2011+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a779dee1c1cb406dbbff6013c989b56d6933c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,167,121,222,225,193,203,64,109,187,255,96,19,201,137,181,109,105,51,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
