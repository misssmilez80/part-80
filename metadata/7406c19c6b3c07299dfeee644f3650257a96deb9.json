The player takes the role of Christopher Stone, a plumber-turned American Resistance movement leader who fights against the Red Army that invades and occupies New York City. It was developed by IO Interactive, using a modified version of the Hitman 2: Silent Assassin game engine, and published by Electronic Arts.\n\nFreedom Fighters is a third-person shooter, in which the player navigates through the streets of New York while fighting the Soviet forces. The game also contains squad-based elements, having a charisma meter. The player gains charisma by performing heroic deeds in the resistance movement against the invading forces, like capturing a base or destroying vital supplies. The more charisma that is gained, the more squadmates the character can recruit, including leaderless guerrillas and wounded Russian soldiers, up to a maximum of twelve.\n\nFreedom Fighters uses a simple method of controlling recruits in battle. In the game, the player can command recruits by giving them simple orders such as &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, and &quot;defend&quot;, but in most situations, they take care of themselves. Given the terrain of New York City after the initial invasion, the Resistance usually stations its soldiers in covered positions like craters and buildings.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n    Microsoft Windows(r) 98/2000/ME/XP/Vista\n    Pentium III 733MHz or comparable\n    128MB RAM\n    32MB Direct3D with Hardware T&amp;L capable video card with DirectX 8.0 or higher video card\n    650MB HDD space\n    4 speed CD-ROM\n    DirectX 8.1 compatible sound card\n    DirectX 8.1 or higher\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7406c19c6b3c07299dfeee644f3650257a96deb9","amp;dn":"Freedom+Fighters+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7406c19c6b3c07299dfeee644f3650257a96deb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,6,193,156,107,60,7,41,157,254,238,100,79,54,80,37,122,150,222,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
