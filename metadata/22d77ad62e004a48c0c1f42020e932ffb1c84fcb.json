Enjoy!\n\nHarriet Klausner: &quot;Keith Donohue writes a great novel that will have readers debating the impact of nurturing and naturing as both Henrys adapt and adjust, but never feel whole. This is a fantastic fantasy that readers will enjoy immensely.&quot; Read Harriet Klausner's review\n\nW. Boudville: &quot;An updated and realistic Peter Pan. Keith Donohue has produced an exquisite first novel. Exceedingly polished prose with a compelling and original twist on a classic theme.&quot; Read W. Boudville's review\n\nJohn Kwok: &quot;Inspired by the W. B. Yeats poem &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;, Keith Donohue's novel of the same title is a fine addition to the fantasy literature genre, yet told with the ample realism one expects from great works of mainstream literature.&quot; Read John Kwok's review\n\nA. Joseph Haschka: &quot;The Stolen Child is a fairy tale for adults that transcends standard fare. An ingeniously crafted tale about hobgoblins, is a coming of age story and one about identities both lost and found.&quot; Read A. Joseph Haschka's review\n\nRobert Morris: &quot;Donohue brilliantly explores all manner of themes, many of which are found in the most popular fairy tales and nursery rhymes (e.g. fear of separation from oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family, especially from parents). &quot; Read Robert Morris's review\n\nDonald Mitchell: &quot;What would it like to be adopted and have your head full of fantasies? It might feel very much like this story. However, I think a story about an adopted child without the parallel changeling world would have been more interesting. Perhaps I lack a sense of romance and sympathy for the strivings of the dispossessed. If so, the fault is mine, not that of the story.&quot; Read Donald Mitchell's review\n\nJoanna Daneman: &quot;I found the writing stunningly simple and gripping. Within minutes, I was completely drawn into this book. I am a very finicky fiction reader, and I was delighted by Donohue's incredibly ability to make sensory experiences real, to make conversations flow naturally and logically--yet leading to surprise after surprise.&quot; Read Joanna Daneman's review\n\nCharles Ashbacher: &quot;The book moves back and forth between the two Henry's, how the substitute Henry handles his assimilation into human society and how the original adapts to the society that kidnapped him. It is an interesting story, as both &quot;boys&quot; have different perspectives on the life of a &quot;growing&quot; boy.&quot; Read Charles Ashbacher's review\n\nLawyeraau: &quot;This haunting and beautifully written debut novel had me compulsively turning its pages. I simply could not put it down! The author has created a fantasy world that exists on the cusp of the consciousness of humans. It is a world that is the stuff of fairy tales, only the author has turned it into one that is fitting for adults.&quot; Read Lawyeraau's review\n\nGail Cooke: &quot;It has been called magical, beguiling, remarkable, and vividly imagined. The Stolen Child is all of that, and much more. Keith Donohue's debut novel is an intriguing mix of imagination and reality, a story that reminds us of the joys of being human and the transcendency of love.&quot; Read Gail Cooke's review\n\nGrady Harp: &quot;Longing to belong is but one of the essential facts of life that author Keith Donohoe weaves into his debut novel, The Stolen Child, a stunning work of fiction that brings alive an ages old myth involving faeries, hobgoblins, changelings and magical transformations to confront contemporary readers with food for thought about being careful of what you wish for!&quot; Read Grady Harp's review\n\nLee Carlson: &quot;The story is as much a celebration of memory as it is in belaboring its mysteries. Every character acts in concert to remind the reader of the subtlety of memory along with its power.&quot; Read Lee Carlson's review\n\nDaniel Jolley: &quot;Keith Donohue has brought forth a magical debut novel full of insights into childhood and adulthood and the seemingly endless longing that largely defines both. He conjures a world of ancient legend and places it on the outskirts of modern civilization, thereby casting an insightful eye upon both.&quot; Read Daniel Jolley's review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d77ad62e004a48c0c1f42020e932ffb1c84fcb","amp;dn":"The+Stolen+Child+by+Keith+Donohue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d77ad62e004a48c0c1f42020e932ffb1c84fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,215,122,214,46,0,74,72,192,193,244,32,32,233,50,255,177,200,79,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
