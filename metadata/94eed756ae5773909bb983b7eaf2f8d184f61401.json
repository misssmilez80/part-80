It is shot beautifully, the acting is first-\nrate, and Monsieur Richard's story is very engaging.\n  I've hardcoded the English subtitles into the video stream. I ripped them,\nthen editted out the English, and any French that seemed unnecessary (we\nall know what &quot;oui&quot; means, non?). It seemed to me that virtually all new TVs\nand widescreen LCDs are 16:9 aspect ratio now, so instead of encoding the\nmovie strictly to its 2.35 AR then hardcoding the subs over top of the image,\nI shifted the image up, left a black bar on the bottom and rendered the subs\ninside their own field. The file itself has been coded with a 1.78 AR, which\nwill fit perfectly inside the AR of a widescreen monitor, but the movie is\nstill in its original 2.35. The audio stream is clean 5.1, spoken in French,\nEnglish, and accented English (per orginal).\n  I can't say enough about this film, it is so much more than a &quot;sports\nflick&quot; or &quot;hockey film&quot;. Some of the best CanCon out there.\n  Should recode to NTSC compliant DVD for those so inclined.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*****************************************************************************\n                     Maurice Richard - The Rocket\n*****************************************************************************\n\n\nPS\nI forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of &quot;Man Alive&quot; (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94eed756ae5773909bb983b7eaf2f8d184f61401","amp;dn":"Maurice+Richard+-+The+Rocket+%28English+hardsubbed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94eed756ae5773909bb983b7eaf2f8d184f61401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,238,215,86,174,87,115,144,155,185,131,183,234,242,248,209,132,246,20,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
