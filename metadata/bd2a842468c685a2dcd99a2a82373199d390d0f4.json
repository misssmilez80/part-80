Now she knows.\n\n\nPOtHS 2 - Bible Movies - 03 - When Gods Spirit Moves\n\nDescription:\n\nWhen's God Spirit Moves\n\nPastor Jim Cymbala explores the person and work of the Holy Spirit in this six-session DVD study that will bring a fresh sense of GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power to your church and your life as a follower of Jesus.\n\nDescription:\nWhat happens when the Holy Spirit moves in a church?\n\nSession 1 - The Spirit at Work:\n\n\nLearn about the person of the Holy Spirit and why it is important for us to make room for the work of the Spirit in our lives and in our churches.\n\nWhy do we tend to ignore or downplay the work of the Spirit?\n\nIn what areas of life should we look for and expect the Spirit?\n\n\nSession 2 - The SpiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Creates:\n\nOne of the unique works of the Spirit is to give life and empowerment to GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creation.\n\nLearn how the creative power of GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Spirit empowers us to be creative, and to honor God with our gifts and talents.\n\n\nSession 3 - The SpiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Reveals:\n\nThe Holy Spirit gives direction and revelation to the church.\n\nHow does the Spirit speak to us today?\n\nThis session teaches you how to listen in prayer, and how to apply the Word of God in the process of discernment.\n\n\nSession 4 - The SpiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Heals:\n\nOil is a frequent symbol of the Holy Spirit and was used by the disciples of Jesus and the early church as they prayed for healing.\n\nThe Spirit is active in the work of healing our bodies, our emotions, and our relationships.\n\n\nSession 5: The SpiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Transforms:\n\nAs the Holy Spirit works in our lives, we begin to bear the fruits of the SpiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work in our character and actions.\n\nPersonal transformation leads to transformation of our communities and our world through the changed lives of believers.\n\n\nSession 6 - Raising a Dead Church:\n\nHow can we make room for the work of the Holy Spirit in our churches today?\n\nHow do we prepare our churches for revival?\n\n\nOur greatest need is for the church to become a place where the message of the gospel is heard and people experience the life-giving power of a grace-filled community.\n\nWeight: 1 lb Ãƒâ€¡Ã¢â€šÂ¬ 453 gms\n\nAvailable: February 2011\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                     Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                          End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                            Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&lt;/a&gt;                                                                               Current Bible Prophecy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                              Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                        Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                     Chuck Missler - USA &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&lt;/a&gt;                                    Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
