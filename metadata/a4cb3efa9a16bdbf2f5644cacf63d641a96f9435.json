Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There, he meets the irrepressible Max, a con man who's grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“idyllicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in HenryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Upon his release one year later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootleggerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and then recruits his former cellmate to help stage a robbery. Henry becomes actor in the theater's current production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; by Chekhov, to get access to the tunnel. However, he finds himself slowly falling for the productionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mercurial leading lady, Julie.[1] One of Henry's &quot;friends&quot; helps clearing the tunnel from mud; he informs the other &quot;friend&quot;, who insists in parcipating too. A retiring guard of the bank helps by informing the robbers when there is a lot of money in the vault.\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRelease date: 14 January 2011 (UK)\n\nCAST\n\nKeanu Reeves\nJames Caan\nVera Farmiga\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Henry's Crime 2010 720p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:1919.46 MiB\nDuration:1h 47mn\nOverall bit rate:2 490 Kbps\nSubtitles:Arabic,English\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-06-08 06:21:09\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/47222520871832206803.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/47222520871832206803.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/18928715125217477998.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/18928715125217477998.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49638641553924425223.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49638641553924425223.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/38322591761894611433.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/38322591761894611433.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/51119313535494337225.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/51119313535494337225.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4cb3efa9a16bdbf2f5644cacf63d641a96f9435","amp;dn":"Henry%5C%27s+Crime+2010+720p+BRRip+eng%2Barabic+subs+vice+%28HDScene+Rel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4cb3efa9a16bdbf2f5644cacf63d641a96f9435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,203,62,250,154,22,189,191,47,86,68,202,207,99,214,65,169,111,148,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
