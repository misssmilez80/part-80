It is located here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5023955&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5023955&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe video features special guest:\n\nMartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nchez, CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nsul General of Venezuela.\n\n\n################################################################\n\n\nIf for some reason you cannot get a seed these torrents, there is a FAST server located here:\n\n66.90.104.17 port 6878\n\nIf you add that server, your download will go MUCH faster! The fast server listed above cannot make direct connections to TPB trackers because it is blocked somewhere. It crosses a Comcast network in order to reach TPB, so I am betting that is where the trouble is... but that is just a guess.\n\n\n################################################################\n\n\n*** This video is featured on Seattle's Pirate Television for the next two weeks!\n\nSee the Pirate TV website for a lot more great videos such as this one.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://edmaysproductions.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://edmaysproductions.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEva Golinger - Venezuela and U.S. Intervention, Media Control\n\n\nBOTH versions of this video belong to the Kopimi Gods!!! \n\nPLEASE share this version of this video with the world!!!\n\nWatchout! The Kopimi Gods are watching you not share this video!\n\n\n\n*** NOTICE: THE VIDEO IN THIS TORRENT IS THE NICELY TITLED VERSION ***\n\n\n\nThis video was recorded on May 29th, 2009. The contents of this video are VERY related to the coup in Honduras!\n\n\nAs you may already know, the United States has a lot of ties to the coup in Honduras. Eva Golinger has written several excellent articles about this subject. Considering the extensive research that she has done concerning the United States role in the coup in Venezuela, I would pretty much consider her to be an expert in this area. I trust that what she has written about Honduras to be nothing but the truth.\n\n\nRead Eva's excellent article at this first link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_56331.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_56331.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nRead more of Eva's articles here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Golinger.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Golinger.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPlease see the related information here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/features/honduras_coup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/features/honduras_coup&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEva's Books:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEva's blog:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.chavezcode.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.chavezcode.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what is REALLY going on in the world, these sites will tell you the truth!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://democracynow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://democracynow.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://commondreams.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://commondreams.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venezuelanalysis.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venezuelanalysis.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cispes.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cispes.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upsidedownworld.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upsidedownworld.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nacla.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nacla.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://narconews.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://narconews.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://diariocolatino.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://diariocolatino.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://aporrea.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://aporrea.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pcasc.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pcasc.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlso these are some good Arabic sites in English.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rawa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rawa.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.voicesofpalestine.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.voicesofpalestine.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nPlease forgive my horrible description. No amount of writing from me can possibly describe the INCREDIBLY GOOD talk that is presented in this video!!!\n\nJust download this version and watch. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!\n\n\nThis event was sponsored in part by C.I.S.P.E.S.

To find her books in a local library, search worldcat. Here is a convenient link to find her books:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nI recorded this myself at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, U.S. and made it into a high quality video.\n\nIt is about two hours and 17 minutes of incredibly good material that is definitely not shown on U.S. corporate controlled media!\n\nThis video does a great job at exposing the U.S. propaganda about Venezuela! \n\nThis is definitely must see material, especially if you live within the United States!!!\n\nAfter you see this video, I am sure that you will want to share it with everyone.\n\nThis is why I have released it under &quot;Kopimi&quot; rules. So, PLEASE copy and share as much as you can!\n\n\n\nP.S. to The Pirate Bay Gods...\n\nI dearly hope that you seriously know what you are doing by selling this site.\n\nI pray that it stays the same as it is now.\n\nI hope that the new owners do not attempt to invade the privacy of TPB users by logging their every move the way a lot of other popular sites do.\n\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't go away, Pirate Bay!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe Pirate Bay is truly THE main outpost of Freedom on the Internet! Where else can you find videos such as the one that I just posted here?
