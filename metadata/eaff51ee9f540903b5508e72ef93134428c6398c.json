Jerry Springer himself.\n\nOpie, Anthony and Jim &quot;Yimmy&quot; Norton will reveal favorite family dysfunctional \nmemories and moments, while Springer will introduce these tales. Throughout the \nspecial, Springer will offer up his inimitable commentary on all the twisted and \nhilarious memories of family dysfunction.\n\nHighlights of the &quot;Opie &amp; Anthony Family Special&quot; include:\n\n* Opie reveals that his parents were so frugal, he used to have to carry his \n  school lunches in old cement bags and shopping bag.\n    \n* Anthony recalls the time the uncle who lived with this family grew pot in the \n backyard garden, but told Anthony's mother it was an &quot;oregano hybrid.&quot;\n    \n* Jim Norton reminisces about his imaginary childhood friends, including a \n superhero version of him, an old lady with a beehive, and the band KISS.\n    \n* The rest of the O&amp;A crew share their stories of mother issues, including \n abandonment, being disowned, physical and financial threat.\n\n\n\nNote: Friday November 27th will be my last &quot;early&quot; 64k upload. \nStarting with Nov. 30th and on, I will upload the 128k vbr \nmp3's in the evenings. If you listen a day late, you'll be \nfine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,\nyou'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will \nbe doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending\nschedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.\n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month (again)!\nGet your O&amp;A here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaff51ee9f540903b5508e72ef93134428c6398c","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-11-26-O%26A+Family+Special+CF128k+VBR+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaff51ee9f540903b5508e72ef93134428c6398c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,255,81,238,159,84,9,3,181,80,142,114,239,147,19,68,40,198,57,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
