Formed by Bojan Bojanovic from Hipnotisano pile and Goran Sinadinovic from Elektricni Orgasam they where not the first ska band or the biggest one but probably the most influential ska band. With only one single recorded and two more songs that came out on different copilation records this band made a huge inpact on how ska should sound especially on todays blooming ska scene in Serbia. No matter what band you ask sooner or later they will point Peter as the main inspiration for their sound. Altough they only recorded 5 songs the band of witch only Ogledalo (Mirror) ever came out on a cd they made their name as a prominent live band playing literarly tons and tons of gigs all over Jugoslavia especially in Belgrade and Zagreb. 1986 radio and tv station B92 had a voting and Ogledalo came on 90th place as the best song of all time while the band itself came 20th on the list of most influental bands of all time in former Yugoslavia. \n\nAs said earlier only Ogledalo was ever released on a cd naturally in one of the many compilation albums of old times the songs on this torrent are not the top quality. I tryed to do as much work as I could to clean them up but still dont expect the best quality. Here are all five songs they ever released.
