Ironically, it is the central truth of The Bible which many Christians believe\n\nboth the book and subsequent film by RON HOWARD has attacked.  Thus a firestorm of rebuttal books, pamphlets,\n\nvideos and television specials have coursed through the veins of media ad nasauem.  With such attention on the book,\n\nit was to be expected that the film would only stoke the embers of controversy back into full flame.  Be that as it may,\n\none thing that has been greatly anticipated, at least by many film music fans, was composer HANS ZIMMER's treatment of THE DA VINCI CODE's score.\n\n\n\nHigh profile book.  High profile film.  High profile score? It usually works out that way.  \n\nIn a Summer filled with well-marketed remakes and sequels comes THE DA VINCI CODE, the most talked about film of the lot.  \n\nHans Zimmer's score THE DA VINCI CODE is a brooding work, well-matched to the religious and conspiratorial tones of the story.  \n\nHans Zimmer crafts a score that parallels the film's ominously mysterious atmosphere.  Truthfully, one could easily sit down\n\nand read Dan Brown's novel with Zimmer's score playing in the background and probably find it an equally accurate pairing.\n\n\n\nZimmer's score is simply a sublime effort, echoing music from two centuries passed.  \n\nZimmer aficionados will find the score sharing a number of characteristics with his 2001 work for HANNIBAL,...\n\nsans the Hannibal voice-overs. However, THE DA VINCI CODE seems go venture into new territory for Zimmer...and delightfully so.  \n\nTracks such as &quot;Ad Acrana&quot; seem to dance on the edge of something darkly apropos, something ... dare I say it, Rosza-like.  \n\nThe range of the score reaches angelic heights and plummets to demonic depths...and, at times, quite cleverly simultaneously delivers both extremes.  \n\nFor a story such as this...one could hardly ask for a better fit.\n\n\n\nDecca Records gives the score a sound treatment with a solid recording, sufficient running time (1 hour 5 minutes 20 seconds),\n\nliner notes that you actually can turn pages in and a bonus track not used in the film (track 7 &quot;Salvete Virgines&quot;.\n\n\n\nWhile no score has ever made a bad movie good, they have certainly made mediocre film's at least palatable.  \n\nConversely, a mediocre film has never helped the Oscar-chances of its score.  Such is the case with THE DA VINCI CODE,\n\nwhile not a critical success, the film has made a significant dent in the box-office.  The film itself will not be\n\nmentioned much come award season, but hopefully it will get due credit in regards to HANS ZIMMER's enchanting work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamples: http://www.amazon.com/Da-Vinci-Code-Hans-Zimmer/dp/B000EPR7NE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1881e88802d051fa8ca52ea24b9d797c6c54cf51","amp;dn":"The+Da+Vinci+Code+%28OST%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1881e88802d051fa8ca52ea24b9d797c6c54cf51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,129,232,136,2,208,81,250,140,165,46,162,75,157,121,124,108,84,207,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
