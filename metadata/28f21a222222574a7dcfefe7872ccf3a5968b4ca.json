Flawless.\n\nTaken from : http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadID=1203630\n\nThank you Lord Maldoror\n\nOverview:\n\nThis is a gameplay video showing how unorthodox tactics evolve as capital combat scales up in New Eden. It is the sequel to Clarion Call - Triage Special though doesn't require you to have seen that video. Triage is involved, though much of the time is taken up with the namesake of the video, Pantheon.\n\nAbove all, at a time when many companies seem hellbent on destroying PC gaming (read: IW and dedicated servers), this is a video about proper emergent sandbox gameplay (and drunk/drugged people being handed Biggles goggles and forced into a complicated plan).\n\n\n\nNarration:\n\nOnce more the lovely Princess Aricia provides the narration track.\n\nEnjoy and SEED Please!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28f21a222222574a7dcfefe7872ccf3a5968b4ca","amp;dn":"Clarion+Call+2%3A+Pantheon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28f21a222222574a7dcfefe7872ccf3a5968b4ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,242,26,34,34,34,87,74,125,207,239,231,135,44,207,58,89,104,180,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
