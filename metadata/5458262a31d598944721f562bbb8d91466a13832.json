Do not use the built-in Symbian browser,\n       but a program like X-Plore (free version works too).\n\n       Step 2: Send HelloCarbide and installserver.exe to your phone\n       (S60v3 Device). Do not open them yet.\n\n       Step 3: Close any programs that may be running on your phone,\n       except the file browser.\n\n       Step 4: Install and Run HelloCarbide.sis. Now go to options,\n       then to menu1. Keep Pressing the selection key untill it crashes.\n       This is normal. You will have access to the system/private folders.\n\n       Step 5: Use the file manager to copy installserver.exe into the\n       c:sysbin folder of your phone. This allows you to install\n       unsigned apps.\n\n       Now Simply send the Unsigned Releases from ErESPDA to your phone\n       and install without any complications. ^_^\n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                      \n                     - -- --- ----  Group  Info  ---- --- -- -              \n                                                                             \n                                We are looking for                        \n                                                                         \n                 - Crackers for all Operating Systems                 \n                                                                      \n                 - Quality suppliers                                 \n                                                                      \n                 - Good 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with       \n                                                                        \n                 - Anything else you think we might like              \n                                                                       \n                       e r e s p d a  a t  g m a i l . c o m            \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    \n     - \u0015  i i -b  -p   K - R  M -t H  -w  R L D -o F -1 3 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5458262a31d598944721f562bbb8d91466a13832","amp;dn":"Killer.Mobile.AdvanceSMS.v1.00.S60v3.SymbianOS9.1.Unsigned.Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5458262a31d598944721f562bbb8d91466a13832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,88,38,42,49,213,152,148,71,33,245,98,187,184,217,20,102,161,56,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
