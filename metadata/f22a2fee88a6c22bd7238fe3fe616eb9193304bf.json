Morgan Freeman in Se7en is the one notable exception.\n\nThere really wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t anything wrong with Robert DuvallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s or Rachel TicotinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performances, but the whole police side of the story is unnecessary and, quite frankly, uninteresting. None of it really serves to further the plot except for the one scene with D-FensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mother where we get a little more background on him. The audience doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to see how the police catch up with D-Fens, just that they do.\n\nfanedit details:\nSL NTSC stereo DVD.\n\nTime needed for the edition: about one week","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22a2fee88a6c22bd7238fe3fe616eb9193304bf","amp;dn":"Falling+Down+-+Under+Construction+%5Bfanedit.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22a2fee88a6c22bd7238fe3fe616eb9193304bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,42,47,238,136,166,194,43,215,35,143,227,254,97,110,185,25,51,4,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
