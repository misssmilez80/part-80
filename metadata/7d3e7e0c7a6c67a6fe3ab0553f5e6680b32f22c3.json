It was \nreleased on DVD by the Criterion Collection.\n\n\nThe Storyline\n\n\nRatcatcher is set in Glasgow, 1973. The city, despite its Victorian grandeur, \nhas some schemes with the poorest housing conditions in western Europe, such \nas no running hot water, no bathing facilities and no indoor toilet. The city \nis mid-way through a major re-development program, demolishing these schemes \nand re-housing the tenants in new modern estates. The problems in these schemes \nare somewhat compounded by the binmen going on strike, creating an additional \nhealth hazard and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a \n12-year old boy, growing up in one of these schemes, which is gradually \nemptying, as the re-housed tenants move out. James, with the rest of his \nfamily, patiently waits to be re-housed. The film opens with James possibly \ncontributing to the death of his pal, Ryan, by failing to raise the alarm \nwhen Ryan fails to surface after the two boys have a tussle in the local \ncanal. James leaves the scene, unsure, and apparently unseen. This event \ncomes back to haunt him at critical points in the film. The film follows \nthe sensitive James as he tries to come to terms with his guilt, make \nsense of the insensitive aspects of his environment, from his heavy-drinking \nfather to the local peer culture, and as, one by one, his hopes of a brighter \nfuture appear to be dashed.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171685/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171685/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 701 MiB\nDuration : 1h 33mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 049 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 33mn\nBit rate : 926 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.129\nStream size : 619 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 33mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 110 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 73.3 MiB (10%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 168 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\nEnjoy!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d3e7e0c7a6c67a6fe3ab0553f5e6680b32f22c3","amp;dn":"Ratcatcher+1999+Xvid+%5BHectorbusinspector%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d3e7e0c7a6c67a6fe3ab0553f5e6680b32f22c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,62,126,12,122,108,103,166,254,58,176,85,63,94,102,128,179,47,34,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
