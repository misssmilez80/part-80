In his mid-70s at the time, Slim's energetic vocals and powerful piano playing belie his age. As is typical of the pioneer Chicago bluesman, he allocated plenty of solo space to his sidemen (which include Hubert Sumlin, Eddie Taylor, Lurrie Bell or Magic Slim on guitar) although there was never any doubt about who was in control. The intelligent lyrics, high musicianship, mood variation (including two excellent instrumentals) and spirited playing make this a highly enjoyable and recommeded date despite the LP-length playing time. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist\n1 You Can't Have It All 4:30\n2 Workin' Two Jobs 3:05\n3 Have a Good Day Now 3:40\n4 Chicago Jump 4:05\n5 Past Life 4:45\n6 Be Careful How You Vote 3:33\n7 Johnson Machine Gun 3:44\n8 Speak Once and Think Twice 4:55\n9 Midnight Jump 4:02\n10 Patience Like Job 4:05\n\nRecording information: Odyssey Sound Studios, Chicago, IL.\n\n\nPersonnel:Sunnyland Slim (vocals, piano); Eddie Taylor, Hubert Sumlin, Lurrie Bell, Magic Slim (guitar); Sam Burckhardt (tenor saxophone); Beau Biley (trombone); Eddie Lusk (organ); Hasson Miah, Mickey Martin, Fred Grady, Chico Chism (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5049ba98ce78a810a4e9c3cd188b0c39c51d368d","amp;dn":"Sunnyland+Slim+Be+Careful+How+You+Vote%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5049ba98ce78a810a4e9c3cd188b0c39c51d368d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,73,186,152,206,120,168,16,164,233,195,205,24,139,12,57,197,29,54,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
