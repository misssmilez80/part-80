Guinsoo then passed version 6 of the map on to its current developer, IceFrog. Pendragon, who is the Director of Community Relations for Riot Games, helped create the previous DotA Allstars website along with its forum.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f46e3b9fe48ae0b708bb924c8fb03d5da7e1468b","amp;dn":"League+of+Legends+US+04.01.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f46e3b9fe48ae0b708bb924c8fb03d5da7e1468b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,110,59,159,228,138,224,183,8,187,146,76,143,176,61,93,167,225,70,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
