This is their first and only album released and is so hard to come by that i had to rip it myself from a vinyl copy i have. For fans of psychedellic and classic rock. Also this whole album was recorded in one take with no splicing. Great Album!\n\nSEED AND ENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f0737d9c09b3ce8e17be1017cd3df9d2c7365c","amp;dn":"RARE+LISTENING+LP+1968+VINYL+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f0737d9c09b3ce8e17be1017cd3df9d2c7365c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,240,115,125,156,9,179,206,142,23,190,16,23,205,61,249,210,199,54,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
