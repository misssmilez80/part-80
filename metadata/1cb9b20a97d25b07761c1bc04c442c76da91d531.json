In principle I do not totally agree with the used methods but I simply could not resist the opportunity and built a MP3 Pop (plus) Database for my granddaughter called &amp;quotThe day before you came&amp;quot. So I&amp;quotm a freeloader.... and its time to do something back.\n\nWhile collecting I came across a new wave in music called Indie (from independent). The technique has grown up and large machinery (and companies) to organize the pop-business is no longer needed. This had and will have some impact, for instance in location (studio to home) and sound (studio - privately used equipment). That means more time to concentrate on the music and more time to concentrate on the words. Like it was when Pop (world) Music started to make an impact.\n\nUnavoidable I came across some tracks that are simply too much for my ears only. 101 of them are gathered in a kind of Personal Top 100+1.\n\nThe collection is called &amp;quotPlay in Reverse&amp;quot because this song from Lex Land sais everything I want to say about this new sound. This song has become my new &amp;quotYesterday&amp;quot.\n\nThe beautiful lady at the front, I found on the internet. She shows what I see. I&amp;quotm 99% sure she personally does not have any problems being associated with the music. If she does I&amp;quotll change it.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nPlaylist 100% clean, fully labelled MP3 VBR files:\n\n001~Play In Reverse (Lex Land)\n002~Paper Aeroplane (Angus &amp; Julia Stone)\n003~No One Would Riot For Less (Bright Eyes)\n004~Heartless (William Fitzsimmons)\n005~Sex On Fire (Kings Of Leon)\n006~Get Out Of My Face (Fiction Plane)\n007~Salvation (Citizen Cope)\n008~Pablo Picasso (Citizen Cope)\n009~Russia (Ramona Falls)\n010~Think You Can Wait (The National)\n011~God &amp; Satan (Biffy Clyro)\n012~Done With You (The Whitest Boy Alive)\n013~Fair Verona (Dan Mangan)\n014~Electric Twist (A Fine Frenzy)\n015~Incredible Love (Ingrid Michaelson)\n016~Something About Manhattan (Sunrise Sunset)\n017~Draining (Silversun Pickups)\n018~Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John (Belle &amp; Sebastian)\n019~November First (The Swindlers)\n020~You And Me Song (The Wannadies)\n021~First Day Of My Life (Bright Eyes)\n022~Some Constellation (Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin)\n023~Without Lies (Aeroplane Ft.
