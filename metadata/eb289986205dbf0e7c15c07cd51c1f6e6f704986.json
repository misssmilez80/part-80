Influenced early in life by circus and vaudeville performers who passed through his family's hotel in Nashville, Dave was exposed to many styles of performance and in 1885 he met banjo player Joel Davidson and became captivated by the instrument.  By the 1890s, Dave was entertaining stagecoach passengers with banjo tunes and comic antics from a homemade stage on the roof of the family's barn. \n\nUncle Dave Macon was one of the first country stars to record, the first star of the Grand Ole Opry, and one of the first members elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nPossibly one of the finest sets out.  If you want to really understand the depth of early country music, then you must have this set.  Macon had all the styles and showmanship that influenced everyone from Charlie Poole to Bill Monroe.  Every single song that was ever issued by Macon is contained on this set and the book is an incredible read. Most recommended! ~ Ben Dewberry\n\nThis is the best box set for the hardcore Uncle Dave Macon fan.  If you want to hear live tracks you have never had access to, and if you want to find out what the older tracks that were only released on 78 rpm are all about, you need this box!  The book is wonderful with newly found photos and a very detailed discography of the recordings! Probably, a little too rich for the casual fan. ~ M. Bailey\n\nPlease see for more information - Schon55 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUncle Dave Macon - Keep My Skillet Good &amp; Greasy CD 1 of 6 \n01  Keep My Skillet Good And Greasy\n02  Hill Billie Blues\n03  Old Maid's Last Hope (A Burglar Song)\n04  All I've Got's Gone\n05  The Fox Chase\n06  Papa's Billie Goat\n07  The Little Old Log Cabin In The Lane\n08  (She Was Always) Chewing Gum\n09  Jonah And The Whale\n10  I'm Going Away To Leave You, Love\n11  Love Somebody\n12  Soldier's Joy\n13  Bile Them Cabbage Down\n14  Down By The River\n15  Run, N...., Run\n16  Old Dan Tucker\n17  Station Will Be Changed After A While\n18  Rooster Crow Medley\n19  Going Across The Sea\n20  Just From Tennessee\n21  Watermelon Smilin' On The Vine\n22  All-Go-Hungry Hash House\n23  From Jerusalem To Jericho\n24  I Tickled Nancy\n25  Arkansas Traveler\n26  The Girl I Left Behind Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb289986205dbf0e7c15c07cd51c1f6e6f704986","amp;dn":"Uncle+Dave+Macon+-+Keep+My+Skillet+Good+%26+Greasy+CD+1+of+6+%281979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb289986205dbf0e7c15c07cd51c1f6e6f704986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,40,153,134,32,93,191,14,124,21,192,124,213,28,31,110,111,112,73,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
