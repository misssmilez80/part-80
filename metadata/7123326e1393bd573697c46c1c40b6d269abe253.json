Prowl the waters as the captain of a German submarine in a never-before-seen theatre of operations ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ the Indian Ocean. Take part in the war against British supply lines off the coast of North Africa and support the Japanese war against the U.S. Navy.\n\nDeveloped by Ubisoft Romania, Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific U-Boat Missions is an add-on that extends the gameplay experience by focusing on the historically accurate but largely unknown German U-boat campaign in the Indian Ocean during World War II.\n\nSilent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific U-Boat Missions Download Features\n\n    German Campaign in the Indian Ocean: The new campaign spans from July 1943 until the end of the war for Germany in May 1945. Operate from such far-off Japanese naval bases as Penang, Singapore, Jakarta and Surabaya.\n    Strategic Warfare: Rise in rank and experience, gaining access to new strategic resources, such as recon aircrafts that track down enemy shipping, and battle groups that can help wipe out superior enemy forces.\n    New Playable Submarines: Take to the seas in new German submarines, including the long-range Type IX-D2 U-boat and the revolutionary Walther propulsion type XVIII U-boat. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of these boats and how you can overcome even elite, late-war allied destroyers with high-speed hit-and-run attacks.\n    Heroes: Based on actual historical figures, these new crew members add a number of special abilities that can change the fate of battles and save the ship when the time is right, as well as adding historical color to the game.\n    Better Accessibility: New and improved features such as intelligence information, navigation maps and upgrade systems ensure that U-Boat Missions will give players the expansion they have been waiting for\n\n\n================================================================================\nSilent Hunter 4 Wolves of the Pacific: Uboat Missions \n\n\nMy first torrent! You should know this by now:\n\n- Unpack \n- Mount the image \n- Install\n- Enjoy\n\nNo crack required.\n\nOne tip; you NEED the original Silent Hunter 4 for this. This is NOT a stand-alone expansion. Also I recommend first patching the game to atleast v1.1, but preferably to patch v1.5.\n\n\nWill seed for a while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7123326e1393bd573697c46c1c40b6d269abe253","amp;dn":"Silent+Hunter+4+Wolves+of+the+Pacific%3A+Uboat+Missions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7123326e1393bd573697c46c1c40b6d269abe253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,35,50,110,19,147,189,87,54,151,196,108,28,64,182,210,105,171,226,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
