That same season, The Great Salt Lake began to rise to record heights, threatening the herons, owls, and snowy egrets that Williams, a poet and naturalist, had come to gauge her life by. One event was nature at its most random, the other a by-product of rogue technology: Terry's mother, and Terry herself, had been exposed to the fallout of atomic bomb tests in the 1950s. As it interweaves these narratives of dying and accommodation, Refuge transforms tragedy into a document of renewal and spiritual grace, resulting in a work that has become a classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de909890b78cf572f19ce390106e143372826931","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1992%5D+Refuge+An+Unnatural+History+of+Family+and+Place","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de909890b78cf572f19ce390106e143372826931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,144,152,144,183,140,245,114,241,156,227,144,16,110,20,51,114,130,105,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
