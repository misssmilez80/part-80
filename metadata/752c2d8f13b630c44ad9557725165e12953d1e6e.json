It was produced by Butch Vig (also the drummer for the band Garbage) and mixed by Andy Wallace.\n\nNirvana's surviving members Krist Novoselic (bass) and Dave Grohl (drums) talk candidly about their past, the recording of Nevermind and about Kurt Cobain and the legacy that he has left behind. Also featured are exclusive interviews with the likes of Garry Gersh (A&amp;R DGC Records), Butch Vig, Jonathan Ponneman and Nils Bernstein (Sub Pop Records), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Jack Endino, and many more.\n\n\nTrackilist:\n\n01: Introduction\n02: Lithium - Smart Studio Session, April 1990\n03: Drummers\n04: Drain You\n05: In Bloom\n06: Lithium\n07: Come As You Are\n08: Polly\n09: Territorial Pissings\n10: Something In The Way\n11: Smells Like Teen Spirit\n12: Breed\n13: Nevermind\n\n\nBonus Material:\n\n01: Drain You - the story behind the making of the track\n02: Dave Grohl Joins Nirvana - The story of how Dave Grohl came to join Nirvana\n03: Going To Record In LA - The story behind why the band recorded Nevermind in LA\n04: Making Of The &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirits&quot; video\n05: Polly (Live) - Polly live in concert\n06: Nevermind - The Album Sleeve - The story of the album cover including interviews with the cover star","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752c2d8f13b630c44ad9557725165e12953d1e6e","amp;dn":"%5BDVD%5D+Nirvana+-+Nevermind+%28Classic+Albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752c2d8f13b630c44ad9557725165e12953d1e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,44,45,143,19,182,48,196,74,217,85,119,37,22,94,18,149,61,30,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
