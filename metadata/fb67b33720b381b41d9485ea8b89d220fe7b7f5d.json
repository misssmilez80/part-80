This involves taking measures to prevent potential failures and crashes before they occur. The software supports all commonly available IDE and serial ATA drives. Based on the type of drive in use, Ashampoo HDD Control provides the user with all important facts and information, including the drive serial number, firmware version, cache size, number of configured partitions, drive space and current temperature. As the number of signs indicating that the drive could soon potentially fail begins to mount, the background guard signals an alarm. For this reason, it is easy to understand why the computer takes longer to read the file, since it first of all needs to locate and assemble all the separate fragments.\n\nBasic functions\n\nInformation on serial numbers, firmware, cache, bad sectors on your hard disk(s)\nBackground guard continuously monitors status, performance and temperature\nIn-depth explanations and information on context-sensitive help\nDisplays all current SMART files with detailed explanations\nAble to export reports for support purposes\nFully configurable temperature monitoring available in Celsius and Fahrenheit\nOption to automatically save all incidents in separate log\nSimple controls and GUI including color schemes\nEasy and automatic software updates\n\nCleanup\n\nPowerful, high-speed disk clean-up\nObjects found can be configured and managed in shortcut menus\nObjects found can be managed using intelligent filter mechanisms\nNew exception rules can be created manually or automatically\nSupports the latest generation of browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera)\nWide range of options to customize configuration to meet user requirements\nHigh level of security thanks to years of experience and advanced cookie management\n\nDefragmentation\n\nHigh-quality defragmentation performed to latest standards\nFully automatic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“proactiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ defragmentation runs in background\nDefragmentation algorithm with minimum impact on system performance\nRange of defragmentation options (fast, normal, intelligent)\nParallel defragmentation of all drives and/or partitions\nComprehensive configuration and customization options\n\nMonitoring\n\nSelf-monitoring, analysis, status reports on imminent failures\nEvaluation of health and performance status of your hard drive(s)\nRange of evaluation criteria available for customized configuration\nS.M.A.R.T. technology provides information on (if supported by drive):\nNumber of hours in operation and start-up processes\nError rate during positioning\nStart/stop processes of drive heads\nNumber of parking sequences for write/read units\nDisk calibration attempts\nReallocations (in event of bad disk sectors)\nController &lt;-&gt; hard drive transfer rate (defective cable)\nAnd many more\nTemperature display including early warning of overheating\nEmail alerts to notify user that condition of hard drive(s) has deteriorated and failure is imminent\nDirect link to Windows event log\nBenchmark\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb67b33720b381b41d9485ea8b89d220fe7b7f5d","amp;dn":"Ashampoo.HDD.Control.v1.01-AT4RE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb67b33720b381b41d9485ea8b89d220fe7b7f5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,103,179,55,32,179,129,180,29,148,133,234,139,137,210,32,254,123,127,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
