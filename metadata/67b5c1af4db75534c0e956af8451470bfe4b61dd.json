We will work with RAW dng images and some type in a branding project.

When sized down, the pixels are not damaged. Deke shows you how to import images into Photoshop as a Smart Layer. In this example, he uses two portraits of a model, kept as dng files.\n\n*** Resizing Smart Objects\nWith a Smart Object, you can commit changes, and resize at a later time. Deke shows us this by enlarging the model's photo, whose size was matched to the canvas upon import.\n\n*** Remove background with blending mode\nYou might notice a seam in the image where the two images come together. To get rid of the white background so that the images blend together, change the layer's blend mode to Multiply.\n\n*** Adjust lighting of a Smart Object\nSometimes, Smart Objects need light adjustments. Double click the Smart Object, and the image will pop up in a new window based on its file format. Since we are working in RAW, the RAW adjustment window pops up. Standard pixel-based images would open as editable pixels in a new window.\n\n*** Apply blending modes for legible text\nDeke shows us how to apply text effects so that the copy is dark against a white background, and light against dark backgrounds. He starts by inverting the colors, then changing the layer blend mode to Invert. This creates distasteful colors, apply more blending modes and adjust levels to achieve a desired look.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
