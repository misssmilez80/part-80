Blue season on DVD, it includes the PSA's. You will need a blank dvd, and a program like express burn to watch it. Another method is to get Daemon Tools, or Alchohol, and do a virtual burn. With Express burn (which is a free software) just copy the iso file over into the &quot;add&quot; area, and put it on video dvd, then just burn it. By the way if you get the free trial, all you have to do is delete and reinstall it when it runs out. But I have a version that never ends :) Enjoy :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4bd0af31b4ad353094c514306b8723c59aa89e","amp;dn":"Red+Vs+Blue+-+Season+1.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4bd0af31b4ad353094c514306b8723c59aa89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,75,208,175,49,180,173,53,48,148,197,20,48,107,135,35,197,154,168,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
