One might have wondered (before viewing this) was it only skin-deep?  In fact he has plenty to say, but it might shatter your illusions.  The man seemed to walk right out of a Tom of Finland picture - so much that he even commissioned ToF himself to do a few drawings of him.\n\nPlenty of talking heads, most notable being John Waters (his usual insightful self, been-everywhere, met everyone name-dropper that he is) and Armistead Maupin.\n\nFor a guy so obsessed with himself, he seemed a little lonely.  Never met his match, I guess... The excesses of being the object of your own art.\n\n\n\nBrings to mind the Magnetic Fields song, When My Boy Walks Down the Street:\n\nGrand pianos crash together when my boy walks down the street...\n\n...Amazing!\n\nHe's a whole new form of life. \n\n\nUncompressed DVD9 VIDEO_TS files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab936e53a9e531fe40995c4f4ad159d504113929","amp;dn":"That+Man%3A+Peter+Berlin+%282005%29+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab936e53a9e531fe40995c4f4ad159d504113929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,147,110,83,169,229,49,254,64,153,92,79,74,209,89,213,4,17,57,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
