It was released in North America on August 8, 1986 and in the UK on December 1, 1986.\n\nThe film was directed by Nelson Shin, who produced the original Transformers television series, and features the voices of Eric Idle, Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, Casey Kasem, Robert Stack, Lionel Stander, John Moschitta, Jr., Peter Cullen and Frank Welker. It also marked the final roles for both Orson Welles and Scatman Crothers.\n\nThe story takes place in 2005, 20 years after the events of the TV series second season and serves to bridge into the third season Set to a soundtrack of synth-based incidental music and hard-driving metal music, the movie has a decidedly darker tone than the television series, with detailed visuals in Toei Animation's typical anime film styling, and Decepticon villains that are more menacing, killing without hesitation. The film features several grand battles in which a handful of major characters meet their end. The film's tagline was: Beyond good. Beyond evil. Beyond your wildest imagination.\n\n\nPlot:\n-----\nUnicron, a roaming artificial planet, devours robot planet Lithone. Though many inhabitants attempt to flee the planet in spaceships, only one escapes.\n\nThe evil Decepticons have gained control of the Transformers homeworld, Cybertron at some point in the twenty years since the beginning of the struggle between the robotic warriors on Earth. The heroic Autobots are using two of Cybertrons moons as staging areas, preparing to strike against the Decepticons. In need of energon cubes, an Autobot supply shuttle is readied for launch to Autobot City on Earth. A transmission is intercepted by the Decepticons, who ambush the shuttle and kill its crew, intending to use the ship to infiltrate Autobot City.\n\nOn Earth, Daniel Witwicky and Hot Rod fish in a lake near Autobot City, discussing Daniels loneliness, as his father Spike is on one of the moon bases. They pick up the shuttles signature, and race up to Lookout Mountain to see it land. They spot the Decepticons and launch a preemptive strike. After a brief battle, the Decepticons attack Autobot City. The Autobots, including Ultra Magnus, Blurr, Springer, Perceptor and Arcee, transform Autobot City into a fortress. As a siege ensues, Ultra Magnus orders Blaster to radio for assistance from the leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime. The next morning, Optimus and the Dinobots arrive to repel the Decepticons.\n\nAfter single-handlely taking down several Decepticons, Optimus confronts their leader and his arch-enemy, Megatron. Though Megatron is ultimately defeated, Optimus is critically wounded due to Hot Rods unintentional interference. Starscream takes command of the Decepticons and retreats with their fallen leader and other wounded aboard Astrotrain.\n\nLater, Perceptor informs the other Autobots that Optimus wounds are fatal. Before dying, Optimus calls on Ultra Magnus to assume command of the Autobots and tries to give him the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, asserting that the Matrix will one day light the Autobots darkest hour. The Matrix falls out of Optimus hand as he dies, but is caught by Hot Rod, who then passes it to Ultra Magnus.\n\nAstrotrains shortage of fuel prompts the Decepticons to eject several of their injuredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including Megatron. The remaining Decepticons argue over who should lead them. The Decepticon castoffs encounter Unicron, who offers to give Megatron and the others new bodies on the condition that they destroy the Autobot Matrix, which Unicron says is the only thing that can defeat him. Megatron agrees and Unicron converts him into a new form: the Decepticon warrior Galvatron. His underlings are reformatted into Cyclonus, Scourge and the Sweeps. Unicron provides them with a craft in which they travel to Cybertron, where Galvatron obliterates Starscream and takes command of the Decepticons.\n\nOn Earth, the Autobots are alerted as Unicron consumes Cybertrons moons, along with Autobots Jazz, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper and Spike. Galvatron leads the Decepticons in another assault on Autobot City. The Autobots board a pair of shuttles and flee toward Cybertron. Hot Rod, Kup and the Dinobots are shot down over the planet Quintessa, while Ultra Magnus and company evade their pursuers and set down on the planet Junk for repairs.\n\nCaptured by Quintessa guardsmen, Hot Rod and Kup witness the sentencing and execution of Arbulus, a native of Lithone. While imprisoned they meet Kranix, now Lithones last survivor, who tells them about Unicron before he is fed to the Sharkticons. Hot Rod and Kup are subjected to a mock trial by Quintesson executioners, who sentence them to execution. Battling the Sharkticons, they are rescued by the arrival of the Dinobots. Grimlock persuades the Sharkticons to rebel against the Quintessons while the Autobots escape. With help from the Dinobots' new ally, Wheelie, the group locates a ship and departs to join the other Autobots.\n\nGalvatron hunts down the Autobots on Junk. Ultra Magnus fails to awaken the Matrixs powers, and is dismembered by the Sweeps. Galvatron, no longer willing to serve Unicron, steals the Matrix, stating that he will make Unicron his slave. The remaining Autobots are harassed by hostile Junkion natives, led by Wreck-Gar, until Hot Rod's party arrives and befriends them. The Junkions repair Ultra Magnus and provide a vessel to help the Autobots fight against Unicron.\n\nGalvatron attempts to subjugate Unicron using the Matrix but is unable to unleash its power. Unicron transforms into a planet-sized robot and attacks Cybertron. Galvatron opens fire on Unicron, but Unicron swallows him. Decepticons attempt to counter Unicrons attack, to no avail. When the Autobots arrive Hot Rod crashes their ship through one of Unicrons eyes and they find themselves separated within his body. Wreck-Gar and the Junkions fight back against Unicron, but Unicron crushes their ship. The Dinobots also attack Unicron with little success.\n\nInside Unicron, Hot Rod confronts Galvatron while Daniel and the other Autobots rescue Spike and the survivors of Unicron's assault on Cybertrons moons. The Autobots and Decepticons work together to fight Unicron. Galvatron tries to assist Hot Rod, knowing that Unicron is a greater threat, only for Unicron to take control of Galvatron. Hot Rod recovers the Matrix and unleashes its power, transforming him into Rodimus Prime. Rodimus throws Galvatron deep into space freeing the Decepticon from control. Rodimus then unleashes the Matrix's true power, obliterating Unicron. Rodimus leads the Autobots out of Unicron's body before it explodes. The Autobots reclaim Cybertron. Unicron's head orbits Cybertron as a new satellite.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player. \nJust burn the files onto a CD using Nero or Ashampoo Buring Studio by making a DATA CD.\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player \n                       (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
