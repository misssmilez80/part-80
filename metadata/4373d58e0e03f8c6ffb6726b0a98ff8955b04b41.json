If you find some leave a comment at the bottom and I will try to get it.\n\nI have 33 songs in total and they are all in 320 kbps (100%)\n\nAll the songs are up-to-date ( All songs were extracted on 2009-11-26)\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER AND BE PATIENT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS\n\nGOOD QUALITY GUARANTEED\n\n\n-commentboy123-\n\n\n*It would be better to download this torrent between 9 am to 11:30 pm Canadian Eastern Time (Ontario) because that is when my computer is mostly used\n\n*Also, even if it says the torrent has no seeders, this torrent will be always alive because I will be seeding this all the time. It might take from a minute to a few hours to connect, depending on when I come online. Just hope there will be more seeders\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4373d58e0e03f8c6ffb6726b0a98ff8955b04b41","amp;dn":"Kartrider+%28Popkart%29+Soundtrack+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4373d58e0e03f8c6ffb6726b0a98ff8955b04b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,115,213,142,14,3,248,198,255,182,114,107,10,152,255,137,85,176,75,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
