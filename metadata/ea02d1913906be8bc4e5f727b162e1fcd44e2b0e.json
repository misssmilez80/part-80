Make sure to download the .html shortcut within the folder, because if you haven't been directed to this torrent from a video tutorial, you need to watch the video tutorial to see how this works.\n\niPhone 3GS users: You can determine which bootrom version you need by checking your device serial number. If the 4th and 5th digits equal a number less than 40, you require the old bootrom firmware.\n\nThanks for downloading, I hope this was useful, and please please please remember to seed ! :)\n\nOh, and consider subscribing on YouTube? Or clicking on an add to get me a bit of cash? :3 Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea02d1913906be8bc4e5f727b162e1fcd44e2b0e","amp;dn":"iOS+4.3.2+Jailbreak+Firmwares+%2B+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea02d1913906be8bc4e5f727b162e1fcd44e2b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,2,209,145,57,6,190,139,196,229,247,39,177,98,225,252,212,78,43,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
