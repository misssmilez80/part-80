In addition to covering events depicted in the movie, the video game also acts as a precursor, establishing the Warriors' reputation all throughout New York City.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Warriors is an action-adventure game which focuses heavily on brawling. Like most games from Rockstar Games, several minor gameplay elements are mixed into the experience, such as the ability to use spray paint to mark turf or to insult other gangs.\n\nThe Warriors focuses largely on gang rumble style action, with the player being assisted by several other Warriors at once. Throughout the game, the player controls one of nine different Warriors.&quot;\n\nNTSC-U\nHave been running it - working fine.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceec68b17c2e2a26cbb9e15a948597ab9ae01b5b","amp;dn":"The+Warriors+for+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceec68b17c2e2a26cbb9e15a948597ab9ae01b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,236,104,177,124,46,42,38,203,185,225,90,148,133,151,171,154,224,27,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
