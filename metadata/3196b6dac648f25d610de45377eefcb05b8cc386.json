I can try another PC but a mini PC at 20 watts (that runs 24/7) saves me over a 400w monster. \n\nI'll keep plucking away at it. I have the 128k's encoded (with an alternate source) but I desperately need to get some sleep so editing will have to wait. I'll try again on the rip tomorrow, but I'd guess it'll be another stereo 64k file. Fucking Friday the 13th..... \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNote: Friday November 27th will be my last &quot;early&quot; 64k upload. \nStarting with Nov. 30th and on, I will upload the 128k vbr \nmp3's in the evenings. If you listen a day late, you'll be \nfine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,\nyou'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will \nbe doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending\nschedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.\n\nI have also started work on a &quot;how-to&quot; of ripping audio and \ncreating torrents from it. It's looking like it will end up\nas a multi-page pdf with graphics and I will include the \n(virus-scanned) tools that I use. I want to have it done \nbefore my partial retirement - it's going to be fairly \nin-depth. \n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month (again)!\nGet your O&amp;A here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3196b6dac648f25d610de45377eefcb05b8cc386","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-11-17-O%26A+CF64k+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3196b6dac648f25d610de45377eefcb05b8cc386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,150,182,218,198,72,242,93,97,13,228,83,119,238,252,176,91,140,195,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
