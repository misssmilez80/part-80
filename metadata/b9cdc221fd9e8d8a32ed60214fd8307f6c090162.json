During his heroic act, McDonagh injures his back and later becomes addicted to prescription pain medication. McDonagh struggles with addictions and finds himself involved with drug dealer Big Fate, who is suspected of murdering a family of African immigrants. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095217/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095217/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9cdc221fd9e8d8a32ed60214fd8307f6c090162","amp;dn":"Bad-Lieutenant.Port.of.call.New-Orleans.2009.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9cdc221fd9e8d8a32ed60214fd8307f6c090162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,205,194,33,253,158,141,138,50,237,96,33,79,216,48,127,108,9,1,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
