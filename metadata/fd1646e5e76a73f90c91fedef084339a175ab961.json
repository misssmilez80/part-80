See the results in Photoshop first. This week's episode is about DIY home improvement, specifically showing you how to create flooring.\n\n*** Create hardwood flooring\nBert received a request to create Parquet floor, which is a simple, symmetrical type of pattern. Set up your workspace by turning on your canvas grid (View &gt; Show &gt; Grid) because we'll be working with straight, even shapes. Choose colors like the ones Bert picks for your foreground and background color. The filter Render &gt; Fibers will create a wooden texture based on the colors you chose. Apply this filter, and your whole canvas will be filled with wood. Change your grid color in Preferences so you can see your grid on top of the pattern.\n\n*** Create planks of wood\nUse the grid to create uniform vertical, rectangular selections. Choose Layer &gt; New &gt; Layer via copy. Make two planks. Darken the midtones of the background layer using Levels. Simply pull the middle arrow to the right. Select another uniform sized plank and make a couple new layers with it. Put all the planks next to each other and you'll see that there will be differences in color - this is good. You can lighten some of the planks for more contrast.\n\n*** Add nails to the wood\nGet a small sized brush, turn off Shape Dynamics and turn on Smoothing in Brush Presets to manually apply nails to the wood in a new layer. At this point, turn off the background visibility and merge visible layers.\n\n*** Create a pattern\nNow that you have a single tile of planks, duplicate that layer and rotate 90 degrees. You may turn off the grid at this point to see the floor from a better perspective. Scale down all layers and merge the visible tile set. Create a pattern from this set (Edit &gt; Define Pattern) and fill the canvas with the flooring pattern.\n\n*** Create marble flooring\nBert uses black and green for his foreground and background colors this time. Set up the tiles ahead of time by creating a checker pattern mask.\n\n*** Create the pattern by using filters\nInstead of Render &gt; Fibers, we'll choose Render &gt; Clouds, then Render &gt; Difference Clouds. Apply this filter several times until you see your desired marble texture. Duplicate the marbled layer into a new layer. Desaturate and rotate the top layer and create a mask. In that mask, fill with a checkered pattern to see the tiled marble floor.\n\n*** Use 3D to apply perspective\nTo give the floor some angles, don't use distort or perspective. Instead, use Photoshop's new 3d capabilities. Choose 3D &gt; New 3D Postcard from Layer. Now you can pull in corners of the floor while keeping the tiles in tact. Apply some spot lighting to create additional realistic depth.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
