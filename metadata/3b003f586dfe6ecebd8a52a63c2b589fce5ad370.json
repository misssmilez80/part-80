Today we are in a position to appreciate how relevant Pauli's work and speculations have turned out to be. This book, authored by a team of internationally renowned experts, provides material and suggests directions for future studies of a variety of deep-seated and open problems, in particular concerning the relation between mind and matter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b003f586dfe6ecebd8a52a63c2b589fce5ad370","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+Recasting+Reality+Wolfgang+Pauli%5C%27s+Philosophical+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b003f586dfe6ecebd8a52a63c2b589fce5ad370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,0,63,88,109,254,110,206,189,138,82,166,60,43,88,159,206,90,211,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
