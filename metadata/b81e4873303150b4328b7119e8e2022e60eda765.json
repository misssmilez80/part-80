Young parents Liam and Caroline Flynn are\n                working extra shifts to save up for a holiday, but\n                who is looking after the kids? Chloe gets a piercing\n                in her tongue, Steve has a run-in with the school\n                bully, and Mikey eats food left out the back of\n                restaurants. This is all because Liam's brother Tommy\n                fills the breach, with his own idiosyncratic brand of\n                parenting. Meanwhile, Liam's dad Jim has met a woman\n                at a car-boot sale. She seems perfect, but Caroline\n                thinks she has met her before, and that Jim's\n                romantic intentions are doomed to failure. Can they\n                warn him before he makes a move?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81e4873303150b4328b7119e8e2022e60eda765","amp;dn":"In.With.The.Flynns.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81e4873303150b4328b7119e8e2022e60eda765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,30,72,115,48,49,80,180,50,139,113,25,232,226,2,46,96,237,167,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
