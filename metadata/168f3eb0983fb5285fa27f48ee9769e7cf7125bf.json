The eventual goal is to be a complete, solid, dependable resource for repairing both Windows and Linux PC's. \n\nSite:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://multiboot.eqisow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://multiboot.eqisow.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nContains:\n\n-- Hiren's BootCD: live DOS environment containing partition and data, MBR, BIOS, and recovery tools, benchmarks, disk cloners and images, and much more\n\n-- Hiren's MiniXP: live XP environment containing AV, anti-malware, and other utilities\n\n-- VistaPE: live Vista environment containing Vista Recovery Environment, GeekSquad MRI, AV, data recovery, VNC, putty, and more\n\n-- Windows XP Pro: stripped down install disk, primarily for recovery console or repair installs.\n\n-- Acronis True Image Echo Server: disk imaging, disaster recovery, and backups.\n\n-- Memtest86+: the standard in memory testing\n\n-- PC-Check: the most comprehensive single hardware tester available\n\n-- NTLDR repair: boot XP machines with 'NTLDR missing' error\n\n-- GOBACK Removal Tool: remove norton GOBACK\n\n-- SAW Linux: modification of the BackTrack4 Linux liveCD that comes with a full suite of security auditing tools as well as AV, data recovery, hardrive diagnostics, and more.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nv0.6.1 Release Notes\n\nHiren's BootCD\n\n * Updated to 9.9\n\nHiren's MiniXP\n\n * Updated to 9.9\n\nVistaPE\n\n * Updated MRI to 5.0.3\n * Default resolution changed from 1024 to 1280\n\nmemtest86+\n\n * Updated to 2.11\n\nAcronis\n\n * Updated to 9.7.8206\n\nSAW\n\n * Updated base from BT4 beta to BT4 pre release\n * Can now be installed to hard drive\n * clonezilla and remastersys added for backups\n * aimage mmls, and R-Studio added for imaging/file recovery\n * New, more professional and useful, wallpaper\n\nSpinRite 6.0\n\n * Added this controversial tool. Many of the author's claims are dubious at best, but many users report that it's still a good program despite this. Use your own judgment.\n\nMisc\n\n * Seperate config for USB omits XP install and Hiren's MiniXP from the menu\n * USB install script now removes I386 (XP install) to save space\n * XP install and MiniXP do not, and may never, work from USB. The only solutions to this issue are inelegent, to be kind, so I have decided to focus efforts elsewhere.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nKNOWN BUGS: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://multiboot.eqisow.org/docs/061/bugs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://multiboot.eqisow.org/docs/061/bugs.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168f3eb0983fb5285fa27f48ee9769e7cf7125bf","amp;dn":"Isow%5C%27s+MultiBoot+DVD+v0.6.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168f3eb0983fb5285fa27f48ee9769e7cf7125bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,143,62,176,152,63,181,40,95,162,127,72,238,151,105,231,207,113,37,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
