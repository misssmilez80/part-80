The kids think up a cool gift, and Kelso had the winning idea: a stolen street sign, but steeling it is hell even on his beloved van. Red enjoys pointing out to Hyde the cumbersome duties of manhood... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 4, Episode 24: That '70s Musical\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½30 April 2002\nThe others all react blasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, except Kitty, when Fez reminds them tomorrow is the spring musical he has been preparing for enthusiastically for weeks. In his innocent dream, Fez is a real star, and everybody gets his or her place, but in reality his music teacher, Mr. Wilkinson, punishes the eager beaver for 'imitating my accent' by putting him on the last row, with losers and ugly kids. When the big day looks like it's a total bummer, Fez is surprised to see... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 4, Episode 25: Eric's False Alarm\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½7 May 2002\nMichael Kelso overheard his abusive big brother Casey say he's about to meet and probably do it with Donna in &quot;Le Motel&quot;; Hyde insists everybody keeps quiet to Eric, Fez spills the beans. Bob is officially divorced, yet marriage doesn't appeal to Joanne, Red assures her Bob and she are right for each-other. Kelso is determined to stalk Jackie now he believes she's doing it again with a Cheese Palace guy, actually rather sweet. Eric couldn't burst in at the hotel, just wined to Leo in the other honeymoon suite, but after he left someone pulled the fire-alarm... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 4, Episode 26: Everybody Loves Casey\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½14 May 2002\nHyde is so sick of the other boys wining about girls he starts throwing things at them each time, and nicknames wimp Eric Daffy Duck. Kitty wins a year's supply hot dogs, so she gives a neighborhood barbecue, against Red's wishes. Eric thinks he can outshine Casey there and win Donna back, but the 'cool' ex soldier rather makes him look immature. Michael, who learned after consulting Cosmo Magazine together that Jackie won't apologize properly for her infidelity, tells Eric his big brother Casey is always bad news for girls, and finally realizes he has no reason to apologize to a bitch who always makes him feel bad, so he dumps Jackie. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 4, Episode 27: Love Wisconsin Style\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½21 May 2002\nJackie finds a way to make up with Michael Kelso who dumped her: he may kiss another girl; alas the cheating bitch reserves choosing her 'rival'; when she finally leaves the choice to him, his is surprisingly romantic, and yet... Eric is delighted to catch Donna drunk as a skunk in bright daylight because of Casey; Bob is a walkover who lets her get away with everything, regardless of Joanne, but when it gets too gross Red steps in, and Casey seizes the opportunity to dump her, publicly. Just now she comes crawling back, Eric's pointless pride makes him refuse to be her 'second choice'; before he comes to his dumb ass senses (even Kitty uses the term) she decides to emigrate to California, where her ma lives. Afraid that Jackie might enforce her 'way out', marriage because she says so, Michael decides to drive Donna all the way; the long road proves tormentingly fishy, as Hyde had first dragged Fez along stealing dead fish and then decided to hide it in one of Kelso's van's wheel caps. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch:\n\nSeizoen 4 dvd 4\n\nThat '70s Show is de populaire retro show die gaat over het leven van een groep tieners in de Amerikaanse plaats Point Place.
