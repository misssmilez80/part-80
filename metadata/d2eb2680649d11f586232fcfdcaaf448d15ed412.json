Formed in 1984, the band had only mediocre album sales, although they did have sellout tours. Page and Rodgers originally wanted former Yes drummer Bill Bruford and fretless bassist Pino Palladino in the group; however, Bruford was contracted to another label and Palladino had tour commitments with singer Paul Young.  Both Page and Rodgers refused to play any material from their former bands and instead opted for a selection of Firm songs plus tracks from both their solo albums.\nThe new songs were heavily infused with a soulful and more commercially-accessible sound, courtesy of Franklin's fretless bass guitar underpinning and understated song structure. Despite refusing to play old material, the last track from The Firm, &quot;Midnight Moonlight&quot;, was originally an unreleased Led Zeppelin \nsong entitled &quot;The Swan Song&quot;.\n\n\nThe disc was ripped to flac using EAC.
