Written and produced by Jackson and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the song was released as the album's second single in June 2001.\n\nThe music video was directed by Francis Lawrence, and centres around a jukebox. Jackson is depicted driving and walking into a bar, where she sings, dances and eventually hitches a ride from a red car. A video for the So So Def Remix was also released, and contains similar footage to the original but contains shots of Dupri in alternate scenes as well as his vocals.\n\nThe original video made the limited bonus-DVD edition of All for You while the So So Def Remix video appears on the 2004 video compilation From janet. to Damita Jo: The Videos.\n\nThe song's looped guitar riff is sampled from America's 1972 hit &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;. The loop played throughout the chorus is an interpolation of &quot;GymnopÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©die No. 1&quot; by French classical composer Erik Satie, played in 4/4 time instead of the original 3/4. Jackson had searched for years for the catchy Satie track. &quot;When I was a little girl and I used to come home from school, there was something called &quot;The 3:30 Movie&quot;, and they used to play the MGM Musicals. There was a commercial. I remember watching Singin' in the Rain and there was a commercial with the lady all in white, and I don't know if it was for Dove or something like that, but they would play this, 'Da, da , da.' It was the Erik Satie. I never knew who the composer was, and this song never left me.&quot;\n\nJackson said she came across the tune again about seven years later: &quot;I was at Ralph Lauren and I said, 'Oh, my God! Is this the radio or is this a CD?' I said, 'Please tell me it's a CD.' They said, 'It's a CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½well, actually it's a Ralph Lauren CD and we don't have it anymore. I was like, 'Oh God...no,' and they gave me the CD.&quot;\n\nJackson said, &quot;I took it straight to Jimmy [Jam] and said, 'Jimmy, I've just got to share this with you,' and he saw my passion and my love for it. He didn't take the actual song, but he kind of put his own flavor to it in 'Someone To Call My Lover,' which takes me back to my childhood.&quot;\n\nAt the time of recording, Jackson had just divorced her longtime husband, RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Elizondo, Jr., after nearly ten years of marriage. &quot;Someone to Call My Lover&quot;, and several of the other songs on the All for You album, use Jackson's divorce and re-emergence into single life as central themes.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64dcff5663bb61476af0df610a560df6003e087d","amp;dn":"Janet+Jackson+-+Someone+To+Call+My+Lover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64dcff5663bb61476af0df610a560df6003e087d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,220,255,86,99,187,97,71,106,240,223,97,10,86,13,246,0,62,8,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
