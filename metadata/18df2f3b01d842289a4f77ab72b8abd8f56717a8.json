They have had a poor start to the season with 2 wins but only over newcomers to the competition Gold Coast Suns (2 wins) and last place Brisbane Lions who are yet to win a game. Richmond Tigers, with Robin Nahas, Trent Cotchin and Jack Riewoldt all kicking 4 goals last week, are in their favourite position of 9th and are coming off 2 consecutive wins but have been plagued by poor starts (they are yet to win a 1st quarter) and inconsistent games all season, being poor one quarter and good the next. Would today be the day the Tigers put 4 good quarters together? Or would the Bulldogs improve and take a step up the ladder?\n\n\nCurrent Ladder Positions After Round 07\n---------------------------------------\n                  Pos P  W  D  L  For Agn Pts %\nRichmond          9th 7  3  1  3  705 775 14   90.97%\nWestern Bulldogs 11th 6  2  0  4  503 472  8  106.57\n\n\nTeams\n-----\nWestern Bulldogs\n\nB:    Dylan Addison, Lukas Markovic, Dale Morris\nHB:   Robert Murphy, Ryan Hargrave, Liam Picken\nC:    Daniel Cross, Ryan Griffen, Justin Sherman\nHF:   Lindsay Gilbee, Liam Jones, Callan Ward\nF:    Brennan Stack, William Minson, Jarrad Grant\nFoll: Ben Hudson, Matthew Boyd, Adam Cooney\nI/C:  Daniel Giansiracusa, Josh Hill, Thomas Liberatore\nSub:  Brodie Moles\n\nIn:   Dylan Addison, Ryan Hargrave, Thomas Liberatore\nOut:  Tom L.
