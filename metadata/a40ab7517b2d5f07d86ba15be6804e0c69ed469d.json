I hear you ask !\n\nThe first time I seeded this baby there were some \n\nmajor problems.\n\nThere were a lot of digital pops and cracks on the \n\nrecordings and I could not give you what I had \n\nintended to do so.\n\nBut afer searching high and low I managed to find \n\nfirst generation cassettes taken from the PCM \n\nmasters.\n\nAlso I found a recording of track 14, The Fearless \n\nVampire Killer which was omitted from my earlier \n\nseed.\n\nBad Brains Managemant claimed , in a post on my \n\nfirst seed, that the album and these recordings are \n\nthe same !\n\nI must disagree with them for the eq and effects \n\nare totally different !\nThe album &quot;The Youth Are Getting Restless &quot;is, in \n\nmy opinion, a completely different album than these \n\nrecordings.\n\nNOTE : These recordings have a few songs which are \n\nnot on the album (track 11, 15, 19, 20) and the \n\nalbum has two songs which are not in these \n\nrecordings because they were thought to be in such \n\nbad condition that they were omitted from the PCM \n\nvideotapes (Rock For Light and Right Brigade)\n\nThe audible difference between the album and these \n\nrecordings are ; a clearer, richer and fuller \n\nsound, audible vocals and a better instrumental \n\nmix.\n\nJudge for yourselves !\n\n\nLine up :\n\nHR - throat\nDr. Know - guitar\nDarryl - bass\nEarl Hudson - drums\n\n\nSetlist :\n\n01 Tuning\n02 Intro\n03 I\n04 House Of Suffering\n05 Daytripper / She's A Rainbow\n06 Coptic Times\n07 Sacred Love\n08 Re-ignition\n09 Let Me Help\n10 Youth Are Getting Restless\n11 Return To Heaven\n12 Banned In DC\n13 Sailin' On\n14 Secret 77\n15 I Against I\n16 At The Movies\n17 Revolution\n18 Live Life\n19 Promised Land\n20 Pay To Cum\n21 Big Takeover\n\nSource : PCM &gt; Cassette &gt; Audacity &gt; CD Wave &gt; SHN\n\nAnother one from the box of old tapes !\n\nEnjoy !\n\nFredheadset.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40ab7517b2d5f07d86ba15be6804e0c69ed469d","amp;dn":"Bad+Brains+-+Amsterdam%2C+The+Netherlands+May+28th+1987+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40ab7517b2d5f07d86ba15be6804e0c69ed469d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,10,183,81,123,45,95,7,216,107,161,91,230,128,78,12,105,237,70,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
