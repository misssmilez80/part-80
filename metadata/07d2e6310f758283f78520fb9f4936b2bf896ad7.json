The instrumentals are worth the price alone.  And when you figure in the fact that Carole wrote or co-wrote all the songs included; I mean the woman has talent.  Historical talent! Listen with headphones and you won't be disappointed!  ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nAs Carole King herself puts it during this concert performance in Hartford, Connecticut, the tunes on this video will represent either a trip down memory lane for the viewer--or a music-history lesson.  King includes a couple of unfamiliar songs (from her then-new 1993 album, Colour of Your Dreams), but devotes most of this 85-minute set to the hits and highlights of her career, with a large, energetic band and backup singers (including her daughter).  Those include such early song-writing successes as &quot;One Fine Day,&quot; &quot;Up on the Roof,&quot; and &quot;Natural Woman,&quot; as well as the still-classic tunes from her ground-breaking Tapestry album: &quot;So Far Away,&quot; &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot;, &quot;It's Too Late,&quot; and &quot;You've Got a Friend. &quot; King herself is frisky as a pony, working the stage with the flair of Tina Turner and even bringing out unlikely guest-star guitarist Slash to provide chunky, chugging guitar on &quot;Locomotion.&quot;  ~ Marshall Fine \n\nCarole King - In Concert Tracks:\n01  Hard Rock Cafe\n02  Up On The Roof\n03  Smackwater Jack\n04  So Far Away\n05  Beautiful\n06  Natural Woman\n07  Hold Out For Love (with Slash)\n08  Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n09  Jazzman\n10  It's Too Late\n11  Chains\n12  I Feel The Earth Move\n13  You've Got A Friend\n14  Locomotion - (with Slash)\n15  You've Got A Friend (with David Crosby/Graham Nash)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07d2e6310f758283f78520fb9f4936b2bf896ad7","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+In+Concert+%281994%29+%5BRock+Pop%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07d2e6310f758283f78520fb9f4936b2bf896ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,210,230,49,15,117,130,131,247,133,32,251,159,73,54,178,191,137,106,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
