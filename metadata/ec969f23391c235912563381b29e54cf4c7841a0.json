Join Atomic TV co-hosts Tom Warner and Scott Huffines to find out, as they once again risk nervous breakdowns escorting Underdog (visionary artist Suzanne Muldowney) to the annual Mayor's Holiday Parade in Hampden, MD. Things get off to a shaky start when Underdog's train is delayed by 40 minutes (nixing plans for a lunch stop at Roy Rogers for her beloved roast beef sandwiches), leading to a high-speed car chase sequence that eclipses THE FRENCH CONNECTION and BULLITT for hair-raising thrills!\n\nMaking it to the parade in the nick of time, Underdog shines in her 11th consecutive holiday march, only to confront her greatest challenge yet... SATAN CLAUS, a Y2K-obssessed messenger of doom who taunts Underdog and terrifies parade goers with his prediction that the world will end New Year's Eve when Dick Clark drops the ball in Times Square. Will this be the last Hampden Parade for Underdog? Or will she defeat the powers of darkness in time to enjoy a tasty roast beef sandwich? Watch and find out in our wildest Christmas Special ever! Plus enjoy wacky parade floats like the 'Reindeer Hunter' tribute to 'Nam POW's and the Shriner's 'Crippled Children' float!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec969f23391c235912563381b29e54cf4c7841a0","amp;dn":"Underdog+Lady+Battles+Satan+Claus%21+Atomic+TV+1997+Xmas+Special","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec969f23391c235912563381b29e54cf4c7841a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,150,159,35,57,28,35,89,18,86,51,129,178,158,84,207,76,120,65,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
