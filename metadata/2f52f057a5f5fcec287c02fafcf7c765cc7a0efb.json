It is the sequel to 2007's Transformers and the second film in the live action Transformers series.

The film introduces many more robots and the scope has been expanded to numerous countries, most notably France and Egypt.

Bay finished the production on time with the help of previsualization and a scriptment by his writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and series newcomer Ehren Kruger. Shooting took place from May to November 2008.\n\nRevenge of the Fallen achieved the highest Wednesday opening gross in history, bringing in $62 million in North America alone and close to $100 million worldwide; this is also the second-highest opening day gross of all time, behind only The Dark Knight's $67.8 million.
