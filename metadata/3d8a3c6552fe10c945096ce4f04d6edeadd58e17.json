Instead of a manly Western, the focus here is on simple character study, even if it does end with a flurry of action. Bim (Jones) is the town ne'er-do'well, but he proves to be of some worth when he befriends a scruffy 13-year-old youngster Bill (George Stone), who has been thrown off a freight train. Teacher Mary Bruce (Helen Ferguson) takes note of the affection Bim shows towards the boy and insists that Bill be sent to school. Bim is also an admirer of Mary's, but she already has a sweetheart, the shifty Harvey Cahill (William Buckly). Harvey, the cashier at the express office, has come up short at work, so he asks Mary to loan him the school memorial fund. She does, but the school committee asks for the money before Mary can replace it. To save her Bim gets the money back and makes it look like he took it in the first place. Then Bill is virtually held captive by a couple who believe he is the missing son of a rich family. Bim exposes a gang of robbers and becomes a hero. In addition he finds the real missing boy and his parents give him -- and Bill -- the ten thousand dollar reward. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Just Pals.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 599 MiB\n      Duration : 49mn 41s\n      Overall bit rate : 1 684 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 49mn 41s\n      Bit rate : 1 537 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.209\n      Stream size : 547 MiB (91%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 49mn 41s\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 134 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 144 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 47.7 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 137 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.5 --abr 144\n      Language : Silent\n\nIMDB: tt0011358\n\nSilent movie with English intertitles; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8a3c6552fe10c945096ce4f04d6edeadd58e17","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+Just+Pals+%5B1920%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8a3c6552fe10c945096ce4f04d6edeadd58e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,138,60,101,82,254,16,201,69,9,108,228,240,77,110,222,173,213,142,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
