In this other dimension or timeline, Nashville was flooded by a wave of bands and artists who rebelled against overblown productions and slick commerciality. Their music was fast and loud, and pundits thought that Music Row could just ignore them, and they would go away. But these rebels came out with Country Music Television, (remember, this is an alternate universe), and suddenly they started to sell massive amounts of records. The first artist on CMT, ( I want my... ), was Rank and File, and Dwight Yoakum would get there in due course. In the way of these things, there would eventually be a mellower sister channel, which welcomed the new traditionalists like The Whites with open arms, and later broke artists such as Red Molly. The upshot of the matter was that now, thirty years later, country music is only just rediscovering huge productions and glib faux emotion. But the biggest songs are still the ones that are descended from that country-punk wave of the eighties. Let s have a listen to some recent and upcoming chart-toppers, shall we? RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Wahl - &quot;Keeping You For Mine&quot; [on &quot;Cumberland Moonshine&quot;] The scorned lover is a classic figure in country music. Renee Wahl takes this archetype and plays with it a bit. I don t want to give anything away, but keep your ears open at the chorus, and you ll see what I mean. The song gets a beautifully rendered spooky vibe. On Cumberland Moonshine, the twang in Renee Wahl s voice comes and goes. It s not an affectation; it s just a tool that Wahl uses to get the emotion of her songs across, and she has others. She can go from the sweetness of a Dolly Parton to almost the sharp tone of a Maria McKee, and Wahl uses this expressive range perfectly, giving each song what it needs. The music has rockabilly accents, and even a bluesy flavor in places, but it is unmistakably country. --No Depression, &quot;My Country Station&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/07/renee-wahl/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd944c021a671179ca39bf0258223c04d58c1d3","amp;dn":"Ren%C3%83%C2%A9e+Wahl...Cumberland+Moonshine%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd944c021a671179ca39bf0258223c04d58c1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,217,68,192,33,166,113,23,156,163,155,240,37,130,35,192,77,88,193,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
