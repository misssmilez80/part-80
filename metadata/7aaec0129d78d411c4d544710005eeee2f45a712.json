If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aaec0129d78d411c4d544710005eeee2f45a712","amp;dn":"Extra+DVD+to+Zune+Ripper+v2.6.66+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aaec0129d78d411c4d544710005eeee2f45a712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,174,192,18,157,120,212,17,196,213,68,113,0,5,238,238,47,69,167,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
