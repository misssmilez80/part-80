As the material from those first sessions developed, it was obviously becoming much wider in scope and scale. The arrival of saxophonist and former King Crimson member, Collins, added further colour and texture to the emerging songs. The line-up was completed with the addition of bassist Levin and Porcupine Tree's drummer, Harrison (both members of the 2008 incarnation of King Crimson), adding their parts to the material in their respective studios.\n\nWhat had begun as an exchange of ideas grew into an album of heartfelt songs, an album that is immediately accessible on first hearing but reveals fresh detail and depth with each subsequent play, as one might expect from musicians of this calibre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7716236312a35417bea4028a44b65cea8ed80075","amp;dn":"Jakszyk%2C+Fripp+and+Collins+-+A+Scarity+of+Miracles+-+A+King+Crim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7716236312a35417bea4028a44b65cea8ed80075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,22,35,99,18,163,84,23,190,164,2,138,68,182,92,234,142,216,0,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
