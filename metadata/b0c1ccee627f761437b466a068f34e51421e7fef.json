Written by Anonymous\n# Susan Jordan, a local novelty shop owner and terminally ill woman, has been given little more than six months to live. As her body destroys itself and her time runs out, she searches desperately for a way to extend her life. When the means to her survival fall into her lap, in the form of a mysterious vial, she blindly administers the treatment on herself. Her life is saved but she begins to be plagued by violent flashbacks and fits of rage. She discovers that Randolph Kaminsky, a doctor in the 1930's, created a drug which would eliminate incurable diseases and prolong life but only when combined with the breath of a dying person. Using himself and violent death-row prisoners as guinea pigs, he discovered that the formula had a drastic side effect: those who inhaled the breath of the prisoners would take on their memories...and their violent personalities. Now, in a race against time, Susan must find a way to reverse the effects before the drug is released into the general population and she commits an act that cannot be undone...murder.
