I'm sure if he knew that this musicdisk existed, he'd say the same thing. Stage 9 is a musicdisk that came out in January 1998. It featured 15 modules from various artists in the PC music scene. It was a pretty big success within the scene. However, few people outside the scene ever got to hear it. This sequel hopes to change all that.\n\nThe facts about Return to Stage 9:\n\nIt features 62 songs from 37 artists.\n\nThese 62 songs = 4 hours, 58 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\nCompiling this project took over 1.5 years.\n\nIt is the biggest musicdisk ever assembled.'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b89390247b8dd4af8a08a037c61cba19e601c0","amp;dn":"Stage+9+%28musicdisk+in+ZIP+format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81b89390247b8dd4af8a08a037c61cba19e601c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,184,147,144,36,123,141,212,175,138,8,160,55,198,28,186,25,230,1,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
