It is an amazing story,    \n         but until now it has never been fully told. Many questions    \n         still remain but one question remains above all the others,   \n         did any of Custer's soldiers survive? New evidence will       \n         prove that a soldier named August Finkle was the lone         \n         survivor of &quot;Custer's Last Stand,&quot; a battle that is           \n         practically synonymous with &quot;no survivors.&quot; Forensics         \n         on the man's skeleton and his two gunshot wounds will         \n         definitely show that the story he reluctantly told the        \n         world nearly 50 years after the battle was true. He alone     \n         survived, and his tale of what actually went on in the        \n         battle will revise our interpretation of the events of        \n         the day. This special will also reveal the amazing story      \n         of seven others who very nearly survived--who rode for        \n         miles away from the carnage only to succumb to their own      \n          fear and turn their weapons on themselves.                    \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         Hybrid 24 and 30.
