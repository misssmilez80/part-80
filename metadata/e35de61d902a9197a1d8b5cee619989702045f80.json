It seems like Alcatraz was just reopened ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ but this time as a true action ride. The Rock minus lame jokes, minus goofy moments, minus incredibility = full throttle action.\n\n\ntagline: The Rock rocks, finally!\n\noriginal film name: The Rock\nnew film name : The Rock ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Thermalized\nfilm studio name : Hollywood Pictures\nedit crew name : CBB\nDate Original Film Was Released : 1996\nDate Edit Was Released : August 2007\nOriginal Runtime : 136 min.\nNew Runtime : 125 minutes\nAmount of time Cut/Added : 11 minutes cut\n\nCuts removed/added/extended :\nPlenty of scenes were altered, too much to mention, but most of all these 5 scenes were really changed or even completely deleted:\n\n    * 1. The stylist scenes: I reduced his gay behaviour and a lot of flat jokes that came with it. He still seems gay and special, but his appearance is a lot shorter and will not leave much of an impression.\n    * 2. The Cable Car scene: What I did is, I deleted the cable car owner form the movie. His acting is so over the top and he is just not funny, but he spoils a cool car chase action scene.\n    * 3. Stanley goes to vomit scene: Well, he still does, but this scene is much shorter. What was supposed to be funny, was not so much. Now he is more of a man.\n    * 4. The Rollercoaster Mourge Ride scene: The entire scene was unrealistic to the max, so I tried to reduce the size of the cave and get rid of the wagon drive scenes. It worked pretty well.\n    * 5. The thermite plasma explosion: Thermite plasma is not your usual bomb or explosive. It is hot like hell and causes a HUGE explosion. And because Stan could never survive to be blown away by that, I changed that, so now he escapes the explosion. I am very proud of this editing work.\n\nFanedit details:\n\n    * 125 minutes NTSC 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with AC3-5.1 audio and a vbr of 4.000KB/s using a 3 pass encoding with CCE.\n    * LANGUAGES : ENGLISH, GERMAN, SPANISH, RUSSIAN\n    * SUBTITLES : ENGLISH, SWEDISH\n    * MENUS : most are animated with sound\n    * SCENE SELECTION : yes\n    * TRAILER, TEASER : no\n    * DELETED SCENES : yes, an all in one 12 minutes deleted scenes mix\n    * COMMENTARY : yes, for the 12-minutes deleted scenes mix\n    * CBB OVERVIEW : yes, for all 21 fanedits\n    * SPECIAL FEATURE : FE Quizshow\n    * COVER&amp;Disc ART : yes, on DVD-Rom part\n\nYour intention for this fanedit:\n\n    * THE ROCK is still one of the most successful action movies of all time and it ranks very high in my personal ranking of great entertaining movies, just because the action scenes were so well edited, the score is so great and the actors are just brilliant. Connery ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Cage are a great couple. Too bad there never was a part 2. But as I watched the movie again and again, the annoying things about it became more and more obvious, which made me hardly enjoy the movie anymore. Lame jokes, most of the time by people which are unimportant for the plot, and way over the top scenes, which became so embarrassing, spoiled the fun. So I decided that something needed to be done, to make this the movie I could watch over and over again, and I think I succeeded 100%. This fanedit is not so much shorter than the original, but the number of cuts is immense. Hopefully you wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t realize a single one of them.\n\nYour way to achieve your intention:\n\n    * By eliminating the thread.

What started so small became more important all the time and the final result is far above what I actually wanted in the first place, when I just meant to remove a few goofy scenes.\n\nTime needed for the edition:\n\n    * 4 weeks\n\npersons involved: me and some friends to preview.
