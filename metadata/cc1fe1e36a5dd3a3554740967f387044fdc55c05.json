Try using: Nero, Imgburn, PowerISO, etc. This will burn this bootable ISO to the blank DVD\n\n\n\nThe activation crack included in this torrent is very special, and using it, I was even able to install the piracy update (KB71033) which is meant to de-activate pirated copies of Windows. With this crack, you can genuinely activate your copy, and continue to use Windows Update without any worries of an update overwritting the patch. \n\nNOTE: Some types of anti-virus software will detect the activation crack as a trogan (AVG to name one). Temporarily disable your antivirus software before activating your copy of Windows. Once you have restarted your computer, and Windows is activated, you should re-enable your anti-virus software.\n\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n\nTorrent Compiled By:  CyberFerret32 (5/19/2011)\nSanctus Security","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1fe1e36a5dd3a3554740967f387044fdc55c05","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate+SP1+%28x64%29+Genuine+Garunteed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1fe1e36a5dd3a3554740967f387044fdc55c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,31,225,227,106,93,211,163,85,71,64,150,127,56,112,68,253,197,92,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
