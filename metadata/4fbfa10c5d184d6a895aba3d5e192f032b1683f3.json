Existentialistic and ridiculous and 4th-wall-breaking and a perfect watch for an afternoon herbal treat. Really should be on adult swim. This is series 1 and was created by Adam Cooley and Sea Monster 3D. Periodically, these two will combine their powers to make 6 episodes, so expect another series before the world ends.\n\nIf you like this film and would like other works by Adam Cooley go to:\n\n- Man of the Graveyard Man: http://www.archive.org/download/ManOfTheGraveyardMan/ManOfTheGraveyardManadamCooley2009.avi\n- Can't or Won't Not: http://www.archive.org/download/Cant_or_Wont_Not/CantOrWontNot.avi\n- Nothing Is More Beautiful Than Nothing: http://www.archive.org/download/Nothing_Is_More_Beautiful_Than_Nothing/NothingIsMoreBeautifulThanNothing.avi\n- No Reason To Exist: http://www.archive.org/download/NoReasonToExist_591/Part3-NoReasonToExistadamCooley2009.avi\n\nFor more info on Adam Cooley, go toor email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2b46594a4f4a46484444474e526b43445f464a424705484446&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; to be apart of his mailing list.\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
