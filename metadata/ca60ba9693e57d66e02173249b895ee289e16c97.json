Norah, also a senior and an acquaintance of Tris's, is dissed by Tris at a club in New York City, so to show she's cool and has a boyfriend, she goes up a stranger, whispers in his ear, and kisses him. It's Nick. Thus begins a night of fits and starts between Nick and Norah as they share a love of music, hunt for an elusive band scheduled to play somewhere that night, search for Norah's drunk friend Caroline - with the help of Nick's gay band mates, and keep running into Tris and Nora's sort-of boyfriend. Both Nick and Norah have to figure out what they want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca60ba9693e57d66e02173249b895ee289e16c97","amp;dn":"Nick+And+Norahs+Infinite+Playlist+%282008%29+%5B.BUP%2F.VOB%2F.IFO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca60ba9693e57d66e02173249b895ee289e16c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,96,186,150,147,229,125,102,224,33,115,36,155,137,94,226,137,225,108,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
