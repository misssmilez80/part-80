The film centers on Jigoku-gokuraku-maru (Masahiro Takashima), a samurai on the lam. One bounty hunter hoping to collect the sizeable reward is Teppo Oyuri (Narumi Yasuda), a comely lass who is an ace shot with her pearl-laden pistol. Before she can set her sights on Jigoku-gokuraku-maru, he is attacked by a hoard of sword-wielding thugs also hoping to collect the reward. He dispatches them with bloody aplomb. Later, Jigoku-gokuraku- maru and Teppo Oyuri -- who has fallen for the master swordsman in spite of herself -- ventures to Zipingu -- the Land of Gold -- in search of a magical gold sword.\n\nInformation:\n\nIMDb Link......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104559/\n\nGenre............: Samurai\nDistributor......: Art Port\nYear.............: 1990\nCountry..........: Japan\nDirector.........: Kaizo Hayashi\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6fe489a90cb0ef9dbe312dba94b858f112d7cfb","amp;dn":"Zipang+%28Jipangu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6fe489a90cb0ef9dbe312dba94b858f112d7cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,254,72,154,144,203,14,249,219,227,18,219,169,75,133,143,17,45,124,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
