An independent duo formed in 2008 with a post-punk psychedelic vibe. Christopher plays drums and creates synthetic loops live, while Alejandra plays vibrant notes of unconventional analog sound, that contrast with her sweet yet gutsy voice. Alejandra is a native Spanish speaker, which leads to the use of English and Spanish in their songs. OceanCats like to be experimental with their sound and enjoy exploring the possibilities the analog and digital world have to offer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c87bfee41ca2c643e6ece75ee8714ece516bc32","amp;dn":"OceanCats+Album+w%2F+Artwork+-+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c87bfee41ca2c643e6ece75ee8714ece516bc32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,135,191,238,65,202,44,100,62,110,206,117,238,135,20,236,229,22,188,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
