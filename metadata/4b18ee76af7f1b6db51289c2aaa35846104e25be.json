Meet an expanded cast of characters\n as you think your way through dangerous, never-before-seen areas of\n Aperture Laboratories.\n Break the laws of spatial physics in ways you never thought possible,\n with a wider variety of portal puzzles and an expansive story that spans\n a single player and co-operative game mode.\n \n\n General trainer information\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Make sure to run the trainer as administrator.\n Before you are able to use any of the shown options below.
