The package adds the following new functions to the product:\n\n\n- P2V Copy to migrate a Windows physical system to a virtual environment by converting all installed software and data into a ready-to-go virtual machine. By providing support for synchronous migration from several hard disks, we ensure data consistency during online migration of a system, which seats on several partitions or hard disks.\n- P2V Restore to restore a Windows physical system from a backup directly to a ready-to-go virtual machine of one of the supported virtualization software vendors.\n- P2V Adjust OS to restore functionality of a virtual environment after unsuccessful virtualization with 3-rd party tools; to prepare virtual machines out of supported virtual disks or Windows .vhd backup images.\n- Connect VD to connect a virtual disk as if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an ordinary physical disk, thus opening up all functionality available for physical disks to virtual.\n- Create VD to create an empty virtual disk or with specific data of one of the supported virtualization software vendors.\n- VD in Volume Explorer to browse contents or retrieve data from connected virtual disks.\n- WinPE 3.0 image that includes all functions of HDM 11 Server + Virtualization Add-on to perform migration or data management operations without the software installation.\n\nWhy Hard Disk Manager Server?\n\nWe offer effective data and storage management\n\n- Automatic partition alignment allows to get the most of physical storages (not all operations are supported*)\n- Any backup destination, including local mounted/un-mounted partitions, external storages, CD/DVD/Blu-ray discs, network shares, SFTP/FTP servers as well as the secured hidden partition (Backup Capsule)\n- Differential and incremental backups, and exclusive file complements allows different data time-stamps with no duplication, and minimizes backup storage requirements\n- Task scheduling and scripting to chain multiple operations into one job and automate execution\n- Exclusive defragmentation for NTFS and FAT (27 strategies, MFT defragmentation and shrinking, etc.)\n- An advanced system of filters automates the process of building up backup contents by excluding irrelevant data\n- Easy management of several operating systems on one computer\n\nWe contribute to business continuity\n- Live imaging and migration for Windows systems with two snapshot technologies; Microsoft VSS and Paragon Hot BackupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ to guarantee fast and reliable live protection\n- Complete infrastructure for establishing a self-acting data protection system that is fully compliant with the set-and-forget backup policy\n- No hardware dependency with the next generation of Paragon Adaptive Restore; our technology guarantees any Windows since XP will boot on different computer hardware (P2P) by automatically injecting the required drivers and other actions crucial for this type of migration\n- Restore at a granular level minimizes downtime if there's no need to restore an entire image; you choose only the files you want\n- Comprehensive recovery environments based on DOS, Linux, and WinPE 3.0 are available on CD/DVD/Blu-ray, thumb drives, or Backup Capsules to quickly get systems back on track when they fail to boot. They also retrieve valuable information from damaged hard disks and accomplish bare-metal system deployment\n- Boot problems correction without restore (Windows system registry modification in the off-line mode, MBR, BCD, and the Boot.ini file correction, etc.)\n\n- Encryption and password protection for backups guarantees security for confidential data\n- Four wipe algorithms (custom, US DoD 5220.22-M, Russian GOST R 50739-95, ParagonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s algorithm) to destroy all on-disk information or only remnants of deleted files / directories without affecting the used data\n\n- Support for any Windows since XP (including Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2)\n- Support for all latest hardware, including all SCSI, IDE and SATA RAID controllers, SSD, AFD, 2TB+ and non-512B sector size disks, Blu-ray drives, USB 1.x/2.0/3.0 and IEEE 1394 (FireWire) devices, PC card storages, and many more...\n- Support for GPT (GUID Partition Table) disks\n- Support for Microsoft dynamic disks (simple, spanned, striped, mirrored, RAID-5)\n- Support for Apple Boot Camp configurations\n\n- Virtualization Add-on for seamless migration and effective management of virtual Windows environments (optional) \n- Technician License for cost-effective maintenance of small, mid-sized or large corporate environments (optional) \n- Get free updates with no limitations\n- Get free upgrades within 60 days after purchasing and a good discount later\n- Knowledge Base and Community Forum for self support\n- Free email support for 60 days after purchasing\n- Take advantage of our paid assistance services\n\nKey &amp;
