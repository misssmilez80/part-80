Public television is where he has made his home, producing many groundbreaking shows and winning more than 30 Emmy Awards. Moyers has just published a new book, &quot;Bill Moyers Journal: The Conversation Continues,&quot; a collection of interviews from his popular PBS show that aired from 2007 to 2010. &quot;The greatest thing in politics in my time is the transformation of democracy from a citizens society-all that moral agency of all those people in the civil rights movement who stood up against the weight or authority and acted as agents of change-to a consumer society, where most of us are caught up on that treadmill, trying to get more,&quot; Moyers says. In a wide-ranging interview, he also discusses the state of the public media infrastructure he helped to establish as part of the Johnson administration. &quot;Public broadcasting, which is a place that treats you a s a citizen instead of a consumer is threatened. We must defend it, we must call it back to its heights. Otherwise we are totally at the mercy of corporate power.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8335408697d6bf9b399aeaa7ba00f9793660f5de","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+08+jun+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8335408697d6bf9b399aeaa7ba00f9793660f5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,53,64,134,151,214,191,155,57,154,234,167,186,0,249,121,54,96,245,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
