With her she brought upon those within sight, a dark cloud of torment and despair. She roams form port to port. With her travels the most grevious of seafarers. Amongst the heathens, reavers, thieves and barbarians ride the most dreadful of men. Siblings from some an unknown continent whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ways are covered in death , destruction, glory and blood. Always ready to command his men to scorch the cities and take all that they want is the good captain Teh Andeh, The tenacious demon wolf ravager of female loins. And to his right, always ready to plow his sword through the very heart of any adversary he may come across is his brother, Jonni Doomcrotch. Word of these men fill all the lands in the modern world with fear. Fear that one day these demons from the sea may pull into their ports. Street murmurs call them The Drunk Death Dealerz. Consider your self forewarned man, children and women alike. The Triple D have risen and they come for what is theirsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nEverything.\n\n\n------\n\n\nDrunk Death Dealerz are a Punk pirate band from Whittier, Ca.
