Robb - Eve Dallas 16 - Reunion in Death-viny\n\nA birthday bash sets the scene for a frightening reunion with a killer from Eve Dallas's past\n\nAt exactly 7:30 p.m., Walter Pettibone arrived home to over a hundred friends and family shouting, surprise! It was his birthday. Although he had known about the planned event for weeks, the real surprise was yet to come. At 8:45 p.m., a woman with emerald eyes and red hair handed him a glass of champagne. One sip of birthday bubbly, and he was dead.\n\nThe woman's name is Julie Dockport. No one at the party knew who she was. But Detective Eve Dallas remembers her all too well. Eve was personally responsible for her incarceration nearly ten years ago. And now, let out on good behavior, she still has nothing but bad intentions. It appears she wants to meet Dallas again -- in a reunion neither will forget ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:794741aa1da9937716046ffbb0881a1521367c25","amp;dn":"J.D.+Robb+-+Eve+Dallas+16+-+Reunion+in+Death-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"794741aa1da9937716046ffbb0881a1521367c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,71,65,170,29,169,147,119,22,4,111,251,176,136,26,21,33,54,124,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
