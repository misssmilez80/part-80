One might think of Glenn Gould and Bach, but even the renowned Canadian virtuoso's recordings of JS Bach are not held in such high esteem as Rubinstein's Chopin catalogue. \n\nRubinstein has such an affinity for this music, and performs the works with such a master's touch, that the listener immediately developes an especially affectionate bond with this marvellous 11-cd set from RCA Victor.\n\nThese performances are some of the absolutely great treasures in the history of recorded music. They have such a wide appeal that they instantly become a must have.\n\nHighly recommended and definitely not to be missed! \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce51189cf5054b3fa2dfac638b84918016e10960","amp;dn":"Rubinstein++-+The+Chopin+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce51189cf5054b3fa2dfac638b84918016e10960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,81,24,156,245,5,75,63,162,223,172,99,139,132,145,128,22,225,9,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
