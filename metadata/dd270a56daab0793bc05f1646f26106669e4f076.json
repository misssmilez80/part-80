I had a nice little Jack Daniels buzz going that evening and met her when I ducked outside to smoke a cigarette. She was standing there chatting with someone holding a CD in her hand so I said hi and mentioned I was a writer which scored me a copy of &quot;Piano Actress&quot;, her new album.\n\nShe asked me if I wanted to come see her perform live in New York and, after checking schedule, I realized that I was going to be in the city that day. I had been wanting to do some video in a small venue anyway and it seemed like a good opportunity to test my cam in those conditions (low light, questionable acoustics). I pitched the video idea to her and she thought it would be cool too.\n\nThere are supposed to be like 5 million bands on Myspace and so many of them have no video or really crappy videos shot by somebody's friend at a live show and that is their only representation to fans. A good video can be like a digital business card for a band, winning new fans and opening doors to venues. A bad video does the opposite. I wanted to be able to produce a good, low cost video option for unknown bands without a whole lot of cash and this film and the associated music vids are my first attempt to do that.\n\nDanni's new album &quot;Piano Actress&quot; is available on her website and through Amazon and iTunes. If you go to her website now I am pretty sure she still has at least one free song for you to download.\n\nDanni Rosner website: http://www.dannirosner.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd270a56daab0793bc05f1646f26106669e4f076","amp;dn":"Danni+Rosner%2C+Live+At+The+Bitter+End","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd270a56daab0793bc05f1646f26106669e4f076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,39,10,86,218,171,7,147,188,5,241,100,111,38,16,102,105,228,240,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
