Horn-powered funk bands, strings-laden Philadelphia soul, and orchestral disco were out of vogue, and the urban contemporary audiences of 1984 were into a more high-tech, heavily electronic style of R&amp;B. Many artists who had been huge in the 1970s found that they no longer appealed to black radio programmers, who had abandoned them and turned their attention to electro-funksters and Prince disciples. But Chaka Khan had no problem keeping up with the times; I Feel for You made it clear that she could easily be relevant to the urban contemporary scene of 1984. No one would mistake I Feel for You for a Rufus project from 1975 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it's way too high-tech ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and yet, everything on the album is unmistakably Chaka Khan. That is true of up-tempo items like &quot;Love Is Alive&quot; (an interesting remake of Gary Wright's 1976 hit) and &quot;La Flamme,&quot; as well as the ballad &quot;Through the Fire,&quot; which was a big hit on urban radio but crossed over to adult contemporary stations in a major way (and was sampled by Kanye West for &quot;Through the Wire&quot; in 2004). &quot;This Is My Night&quot; (which was written and produced by the System) also became an urban radio hit, but the album is best known for Khan's unlikely remake of Prince's &quot;I Feel for You.&quot; When Prince first recorded &quot;I Feel for You&quot; in 1979, it wasn't a hit; Khan's version, however, soared to number one on Billboard's R&amp;B singles chart. Khan had a very different take on the song than Prince; while his original version was subtle and restrained, Khan went for exuberance and added a strong hip-hop flavor. Excellent from start to finish, this album went down in history as both a creative and a commercial success.&quot;\n\nPersonal note from the uploader: twenty-five years? Can you believe it? A quarter of century since we all first heard Chaka's groundbreaking version of &quot;I Feel for You&quot;? Apparently so.... Re. Allmusic's review: this album spawned three singles in the US but no less than five in Europe; &quot;I Feel for You&quot;, &quot;This Is My Night&quot;, &quot;Through the Fire&quot;, &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; and finally my personal favourite &quot;Stronger Than Before&quot;.... (written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager and covered by Dionne Warwick in 1985). Just listen to those final choruses as Chaka literally begs and pleads &quot;come back to me&quot;.... To quote the late Arif Mardin; &quot;She hits notes so high they don't even exist.&quot; Pure magic.\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nI Feel For You\n==============\n01. This Is My Night\n02.
