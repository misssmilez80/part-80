KICK IT incl Update 2 RIP\n\nRelease Date  :  23/04/2011                Protection  :  Steam\nRelease Type  :  RIP 31x5.00MB            Company    :  Dejobaan Games, LLC\n\nRelease Notes\n\nFrom the creators of the award-winning AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA --\nA Reckless Disregard for Gravity, grab the playable Kick It\npre-release, and get the full game when it comes out\n\nBattle your favorite drum 'n' bass tracks, or zen out as you soar\nthrough that trance album. Kick It mines your existing MP3 music to\nbuild hovering, hallucinogenic worlds to fly and fight through.\n\nPicture this: Ten kilometers above the Earth's crust, you plummet,\nyour own music library powering you through terminal velocity. A hint\nof orchestral strings, and gameplay responds with wide open skies\nahead. But whats this? Big, fat bass beats, and suddenly youre\nintimate with the side of a behemoth building -- scrape by with a\nmillimeter to spare, and your score multiplier doubles, then triples.\nA serious drum line breaks though the soundscape: cymbals crash, and\nyoure swarmed by teeming hordes of mechanical monsters hell-bent on\nshooting you out of the sky. Take aim, and take 'em down.\n\nWant to play mad scientist? In Kick It, the worlds you create are\nliving organisms, so if you want to alter the soundscapes generated by\nyour tracks, go on Tweak a tunes genomes, hit play, and watch it\nwarp into something unrecognizably twisted. Dejobaan will continue to\npolish the game -- with your feedback -- 'till its as smooth and\nsilky as an ugly baby's bottom for launch in 2011.\n\nFeatures:\n\nProcedural content generation turns your music library into\nfloating worlds.\n\nPlay your own MP3s, OGGs, and WAV files.\n\nTweak a city's DNA to create your own experiences.\n\nBe part of the design process as Dejobaan creates its best game yet.\n\nGet the full game once it's completed\n\nRIPPED: Nothing\n\nInstall Notes\n\n1. Unpack the release with WinRAR or equivalent\n2. Install by running unl-1123.exe\n3. Start game with 123KickIt.exe\n4. Enjoy\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nApparently this game is finished yet, althrough you can play and\ncomplete it. You buy the game as it is and more levels and content\nwill be added if/when the game developer has got more money. Sad that\ndevelopers have decided to suck into such business :/  Imagine buying\na car and you wont be able to get seats before the developer have sold\nsome more cars.\n\nAnyway, support this game, as it's quite good and remember those WORK\nIN PROGRESS nagging screens - that's how it's sold\n\nRemember to support quality games\n\nUnleashed salutes all friends of the family, contacts and competition\n\n&quot; Prepare to be Unleashed &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ce5c91c1b36a50d6bf021a0d3883ff018e17f7","amp;dn":"1...2...3...KICK.IT.incl.Update.2.RIP-Unleashed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ce5c91c1b36a50d6bf021a0d3883ff018e17f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,206,92,145,193,179,106,80,214,191,2,26,13,56,131,255,1,142,23,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
