It already shows signs of waning in our country. We've lost our fear of God as we've forgotten Him and distorted His Word. We no longer know Him as He really is, according to the truth He recorded for us. We've exchanged His glory for things that don't profit, truth for lies. We've become a nation that fears and worships man. We need to return to God's glory and live in it! God commanded us to glorify Him in our bodies, which belong to Him because He purchased them with the blood of His Son. The world needs to see the difference Jesus Christ makes in those who believe this Gospel. \n\nAre you ready for this life? Are you prepared to live a life that glorifies God alone a life that can influence and even save our great nation? May the Lord empower you this moment to say &quot;Yes!&quot; with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. Living For God's Glory is designed to help you keep this commitment! May the Lord mightily bless you through this study of His Word.\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nLanguage: English / Video Format: FLV\n\n01 Guarding the Glory of God\n02 What Do You Trust In\n03 Ichabod - The Name Below All Names\n04 Glory or No Glory\n05 When the Glory Departs\n06 The Nation that Forgets God and Fears Man\n07 Exchanging the Glory of the Incorruptible God\n08 Full Potential in the Lord\n09 The Inside Fix\n10 Walk by the Spirit\n11 I Finished the Work You Gave Me\n12 Ordinary or Special\n13 Transparent Glory\n14 Suffering- The Pathway to Glory\n15 Standing in the Presence of the Lord of Glory\n\n************************************************************************************\n\ne-Sword\nIf you would like to reference the verses mentioned in this series you can download free bible study software at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.e-sword.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.e-sword.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nVisit us at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dreamingofheaven.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dreamingofheaven.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99c3713eb37ae38f7ccfe73ac978ac5cbeca2e7","amp;dn":"Kay+Arthur+-+Living+for+God%5C%27s+Glory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99c3713eb37ae38f7ccfe73ac978ac5cbeca2e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,156,55,19,235,55,174,56,247,204,254,115,172,151,138,197,203,236,162,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
