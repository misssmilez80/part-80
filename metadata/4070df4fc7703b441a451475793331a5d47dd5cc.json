The problem? The legendary journalist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ best known for his incisive interviews with former president Richard Nixon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ works for al JazeeraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s English channel and cable providers only began carrying it in the U S capital on July 1, while over 100 countries have watching for a long time. On Reliable Sources, Frost told Howard Kurtz why Al Jazeera English may have gotten a bad rap from its association with its Arabic counterpart, famous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or infamous, depending on your point of view ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for carrying many of the video and audio messages from Osama Bin Laden. &quot;Every companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ delighted at those Osama bin Laden tapes. You see, they'd drop them through the letter box. They seem to be dropping them through our [Al Jazeera English's] letter boxes now. But from that, I mean, once they decided to use them, and there are lots they didn't use. But I mean once they decided to use them, so did the BBC, so did ITV, so did CBS, NBC, ABC. Everyone wanted them. And they just happened to be the lucky recipients,&quot; Frost said. &quot;Al Jazeera English came along and it immediately, people see it, they realize that it's independent, that it's international, that it's for the south as well as the north. And you can see it's not about Osama bin Laden any more than any other network is.&quot; Frost was one of the well-known personalities who gave the channel instant credibility, and said that he has complete editorial independence. \n\nStreaming video: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/07/12...ra-english-nixon/ \n\nOther shunster posts\nWatch Al Jazeera Live: http://www.livestation.com/channels/3-al_jazeera_english or call your cable company anywhere.\n\nVisit and join us at: ConspiracyCentral.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4070df4fc7703b441a451475793331a5d47dd5cc","amp;dn":"David+Frost+on+Nixon%2C+Yoko+Ono%2C+Al+Jazeera+2009+07+12+CNN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4070df4fc7703b441a451475793331a5d47dd5cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,112,223,79,199,112,59,68,26,69,20,117,121,51,49,165,212,125,213,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
