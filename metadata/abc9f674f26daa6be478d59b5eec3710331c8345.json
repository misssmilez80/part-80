(48 kbps / 44kHz Mono Fraunhofer CBR using jetAudio 8+). \n\n \n[1992]\nThis is a fabulous collection of seven unabridged stories featuring the indomitable barrister, Horace Rumpole. These stories, written by John Moritimer, who was himself a barrister, offer a satirical look inside the British legal system. Best yet, they take an in-depth look at Rumpole - his life, his style, and his keen knack for getting to the bottom of 'things'. As a barrister (a lawyer who specializes in appearing in court vs. working behind the scenes), Rumpole is intrigued and charged with upholding the law. However, he is more than willing to cut a few corners and engage in various shenanigans in order to see that justice reigns supreme - even if what he sees as justice is not exactly what the 'law' demands.\n\nThis audio book contains these stories:\nRumpole and the Children of the Devil\nRumpole and the Eternal Triangle\nRumple and the Miscarriage of Justice\nRumpole and the Family Pride\nRumpole and the Soothsayer\nRumpole and the Reform of Joby Jonson\nRumpole on Trial.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc9f674f26daa6be478d59b5eec3710331c8345","amp;dn":"Rumpole+on+Trial+-+John+Mortimer++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc9f674f26daa6be478d59b5eec3710331c8345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,201,246,116,242,109,170,107,228,120,213,155,94,236,55,16,51,28,131,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
