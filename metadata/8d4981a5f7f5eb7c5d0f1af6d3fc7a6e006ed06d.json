For you see bitches, I have not been using Eset for an entire week for the first time in 3+ years. Thats because I have found something better - like the first time getting a finger in the bum it feels so odd and strange but after a while you can't get anywhere with out it and cant even remember how things were before. \n\nOf course I'm referring to Avast! 5 free edition. You download it, click register, put what ever the hell you want and you have free a/v for an entire year until you have to re-register doing the same exact thing i just told you to do. Be sides having a MUUUUCH better detection rate than ESET this damn this is also HALF THE MOTHER FUCKING SIZE as far as ram usage goes! I thought at first it wasnt working, it only uses 16mb of ram on average. best part is no cracking, no hacking the damn thing has everything you'd ever need in a a/v with semi-firewall (or whatever that damn thing is)\n\nDont take my brainwashed word for it, install it in your nearest virtual machine - or your moms computer when shes not home (and sent me photos of her)\n\n\nIts good enough for me and therefore its good enough for you! Now shut the fuck up, and get it before you meet the back of my hand!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLatez bitches! \n\n[--------------------------Just fucking do already--------------------------------]\n\n&quot;My advise, don't get this piece of fecal matter&quot;\n\n                                   -jmb2012 VIP\n\n\n\n                                        ``.-+shmmmNNNm/                         \n                                     :sNMMNNNNNmNNNNNNNs`                       \n                                    sNMMMMMMMMNNNMMMNNNNm+.                     \n                               .shdNNMMMNNNNmmmmdmmNNMNNMNNs.                   \n                             +mNNmddddddddmddhhhhhyhdmNNNNNNd-                  \n                           .ydNmho+/+ossosssssssssyyyyhdmmNNNNy`                \n                          `ydmds+//:::::///////++oossssyhddmNNNm/               \n                          :hhyo+/:::-------:::--:+ossssyyhdddmmmmh`             \n                         `yhyo//::------------:::/+syhhyyhddmdmmmmy             \n                         ohho+/::-----------:/::::/+oyhdmmmmmmmNmmmd-           \n                        `ddyo/:::---.--:+oso+////+//++sydmNNNNNNmdmmh           \n                         /hhsyyys+/-..--::::----::::/+/+oydmNNNNNdddm+          \n                          :y+/:--:+/-.---:///::/+/::-://+oyhdmhsshddmd-         \n                           ++o+//+o:------+syhhy+::::::/++oyhoo/oyhhdmmy        \n                           /+ydhyso-------:::::::::::://++osyso+/yddddms        \n                           ://://+:--::------:::----:::/++ooso+/+sddhhds        \n                           o:::/++-.--:::-----------::/+++oss++ooymmdhdo        \n                           y///::++//++:----------::::/+++oso//+sdmmmhhdy`      \n                           -h++/:://------------:::::////+oyhyhdNmmdmmddm`      \n                            /hso::::-------:-:::::::::://oshdhmdNNmmmNddm-      \n                            omdso++/+////////::-::--:::/+oyhNNNNMNmNmNNdd:/     \n                 .....      ydNyssss+os+:::::::::::::://oshmNNNNMNNNmNNNmsN-    \n            -/++oo////o    `ddmms+++ooo///:::::::::::/+osydNNNNMNNNmmNNNNmNo    \n       -..-:o//++sy+//+-   smmmmysss+////::::://::::/+oyhdNNNNNNNNNNNNNNmNmh    \n      :+///sho///+yyo+shyyddmoyMNNyo+///:::::://///+oyyyhmmmNNmdmNNmmmmmmNNm.   \n .o/`-so////sd+//++ooyddmms+/ oMNMNh+++////////++syysooyddmmmdhmNmmmNNNNNNNo.   \n:sooos+oo+/++hy++/+sdyyhhhhyssdNNNNMmhyysssyyyyyyso++ohddmdmmdmNNNNNNNNMMMN     \noys++/+:oso+oyms+:/ymo++//+ssmh/+ydmNNNNNmdhhyysoooosdmdddmNNNNNNmddhhddmmd     \n`shso+oshdso+sdysssyddyo+/:::/oo++osoymmmdhyyyyoooosymdydmNNmdhyyssosssssyhyy+` \n :yhddhyyhddhdmhss++/+yhy+///://+ooo++shmdhyhysooossymhyhdhssoooooooooooossyhdy.\n /+yyhhdddyyyymNhyo++o++osys////+ossysoosyhhsooossssyysossooooooo+++++++oosyyhdh\n\n                         &quot;SPIT OUT THAT CRACK PIPE YOU WHORE&quot;\n\n=====================================REPOST========================================\n\nSame shit as last time, only better.

Introducing ESET NOD32 AntiVirus System\nwhich is pretty much like 3.0 only with a different interface. It uses the \nsame definitions  and the same engine. \n\nBut rather than guzzling RAM the way your current gf guzzles other \npeoples mayonnaise (YEP she lied to you, the only extra buttery popcorn \nshe  had was one topped with semen), it only uses about half the resources\nyet offers the same protection(which is something you should consider\nwearing) .\n\nNow your probably saying to yourself (i know cuz im right behind you)\nwell arenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t there other fucking NOD32 v2 uploads that donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t work for shit.\n\nAnd you'd be right, you motherfucker-cocksucker, actually I didn't even\nmake either of these, what I did do is take 2 torrents, one with a known\ngood installer but a bad patcher and another visa versa - and guess\nwhat I did next, and for once it does not involve your mother.\n\nSo Shut the fuck up, download it, try it, fucking love and sex it up\n(after Im gone please).\n\nHeres a fucking description and fucking installations instructions.\n\n==================DESCRPTION==========================\nESET's NOD32 Key Features\n\n* ThreatSenseÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« technology ? a single optimized Anti-Threat engine for analyzing code to identify malicious behavior, such as viruses, spyware, adware, phishing and more\n* Unprecedented heuristic analysis capable of discovering new malware threats as they emerge\n* Powerful virtual PC emulation technology enables unpacking and decryption of all types of archives and run-time packing\n* Protects at multiple infiltration points, including HTTP, POP3, SMTP and all local and removable media\n* Enhanced Rootkit Protection\n* Prevents infected files from being opened and executed, and warns on creation of infected files\n* Automatic execution on system startup\n* Supports multiple Terminal Server environments\n* Supports scanning of mapped network disks\n\nChanges in 2.70.39:\nThis release fixes a stack overflow vulnerability which could allow arbitrary code execution.\n\nThreatSenseÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« technology ? a single optimized Anti-Threat engine for analyzing code to identify malicious behavior, such as viruses, spyware, adware, phishing and more\nUnprecedented heuristic analysis capable of discovering new malware threats as they emerge\nPowerful virtual PC emulation technology enables unpacking and decryption of all types of archives and run-time packing\nProtects at multiple infiltration points, including HTTP, POP3, SMTP and all local and removable media\nEnhanced Rootkit Protection\n\nPrevents infected files from being opened and executed, and warns on creation of infected files\nAutomatic execution on system startup\nSupports multiple Terminal Server environments\nSupports scanning of mapped network disks\n\n===================HOW TO INSTALL=====================\n \n\n- Install NOD32\n\n- Select Typical Installation\n\n- During installation Push &quot;Set update parameters later&quot;.\n\n\n- Dont`t reboot when installation complete.\n\n- Install NOD32 FiX v2.1.exe\n\n-  Now restart PC and update that shit NIGGA.\n\n- Now you have NOD32 for a mere 16714589 days.\n\nFucking Enjoy.  \n\nMD5's\n\nFBD455F1CCD102AC012F94B4879416A0  NOD32.FiX.v2.2.exe\nF1FEC6B5208A0BE6E42C6813440806B9  NOD32.v2.70.39.Installer.exe\n1AE31056E0D279B575E2199E1D5CCE18  READ ME 1st DUMASS.txt\n\nFUCK YEAH!!!!\n\n================About Me===============================\n\nHere I fucking am http://thepiratebay.se/user/fuwad84/ \n\nFOR NOW!  \n\nIF YOU FUCKING LIKE IT PLEASE SEED! If not THAN FUCK OFF!\n\n\n\n========================SHOUT OUTS TO MY FAVORITE SHIT ON TPB====================\n\nSince I'm noticing more and more people seeding this torrent I thought why not enlighten visitors with the various other great, light and simple to install programs that I put on nearly every computer that I work on. Keep in mind I wouldn't be giving a shout out to it if I didn't use it myself.  \n\n------------------ESET Smart Security Business Edition by HeartbuG----------------\n\nBasically its the worlds greatest(and strangely enough lightest) combo firewall/antispam/antivirus suite and install's super f'in easy i've used it since july and it has yet to fail me. No need for key hunting and its as unintrusive as hell as best of all its uploaded by HeartbuG one of PirateBays best known crackers.\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4257661/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4257661/&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-----------------------Microsoft Office 2003 Lite by FalconFour--------------------\n\nYou know whats one thing I REALLY hate about most of the Office suites that you get off of this site? There mostly bloat ware, your downloading 300MB+ of shit you don't use. Think about it.. when was the last time you opened up groove or access and if you do use those programs than your probably a rich bastard who can afford the software anyway. Most of us only use 3 programs mabe four at the most -&gt; Word, Excel, Powerpoint and mabe outlook(!?!) Well than this is the torrent for the majority of us who hate bloatware. Its one .exe about 70MB small and installs unattended in about 3 minutes. You get Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook AND NOTHING ELSE!!!\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5129357/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5129357/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso If you want to open, save and edit 2007 .docx files Office Lite will work with Microsoft's compatibility patch which you can get here. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&amp;displaylang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&amp;displaylang=en&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------Macromedia Studio 8 With Working Keygen by Ronmarsden--------------\n\nOk for you web designers, flash cartoonists or photo editors out there - how many of you actually use Adobe bridge or both Photoshop AND Fireworks when there almost the same damn program!?! Im still on the theme of small is best and once again this is the case with Macromedia Studio 8, which comes with just Dreamweaver, Flash and Fireworks all the tools you ACTUALLY USE and no bloatware or shit that MUST update - works flawlessly\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4438534/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4438534/&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n------------------------WinRAR 3.80 Professional by Frezeone----------------------\n\nI don't even need to give an intro to this wonderful filezipping program but will anyway. As far as compressing files go this is the jack of all traits can open and edit nearly any format known to man even opens .iso and other CD image files(but you can mount them with nero6) Best part as if it couldn't get any better - the installer is only 1 MB small!!! And it downloads in 25 seconds cuz theres like 1200 seeds of it, those numbers don't lie!\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4505441/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4505441/&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------Process Explorer by Mark Russinovich-----------------------\n\nNo its not on the Piratebay but its a program I use in place of task manager. Its actually a program that will present in a very detailed listing ALL of the programs, processes, keys, threads ect. running on your computer including ones that try to hide them selves( this shouldn't be a problem if you get Eset) You can see how much resource its robbing from your computer. Like I said I wouldn't post it if I didn't use it.\n\n            &lt;a href=&quot; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------CCleaner by Piriform----------------------------\n\n         (i didnt write any of this but I TOTALLY AGREE a MUST GET!!!)\n\nCCleaner is a freeware system optimization, privacy and cleaning tool.

Not just only is the OS but you even get options as to how you want to install the OS and the iso its self is also a standalone boot disk that has a linux based back up incase you need to get online but your HD crashed. I could go on all day how great this OS but I'm tired and have to get up soon. Its the OS that I am using as im typing this - Ive used it since August and have not had a single problem with it and its so nice surfing Microsofts website for driver updates seeing as how it will pass WGA.\n \n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4206516/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4206516/&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ATTENTION FIREFOX USERS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n&quot;CONGRATULATIONS YOU'VE WON A NEW YADDA YADDA&quot; TIRED OF THAT?
