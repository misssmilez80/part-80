Auten \nDirectors: Don Rush, Yasuhiro Takemoto \nWriters: Yasuhiro Takemoto, Fumihiko Shimo, Mike Yantosca, Shouji Gatou \nProducers: John Ledford, Mark Williams \nLanguage: English, Japanese \nStudio: Adv Films \nDVD Release Date: October 18, 2005 \nRun Time: 75 minutes \n\nThe second season of Full Metal Panic comes to an appropriately nutty conclusion. The Yakuza hit men Kaname encountered in episode 4 return: they work for the father of her friend Ren. Their inept family gang is losing its turf to a pack of upstarts, so Kaname brings in Sousuke to train them--as the giant plushie Bonta-kun! The filmmakers spoof all the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s of military movies: they have the &quot;recruits&quot; sing the Marine marching chant &quot;Everywhere we go...&quot; in &quot;Fumoffus.&quot; Sousuke is delighted with the performance of the armored Bonta-kun suits and can't understand why more arms dealers don't stock them. All three episodes provide the special blend of slapstick comedy and grudging romance that made Full Metal Panic a hit on both sides of the Pacific. Watching the end of the series is a bit like having a friend move away, but a third season is reportedly in the works. (Rated TV PG V: comic violence, nudity) --Charles Solomon \n\nHere it is the full-on, all-out-crazy finale to Full Metal Panic? FUMOFFU! And it seems that EVERYONE has gone completely mad! First, a laugh-out-loud yakuza war brings gangster stereotypes to life, risks the lives of Kaname and Sousuke, and enlists an unlikely army of Bonta-kuns to save the day! Next, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a turf war on the school campus, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nerd against nerd, in an ill-inspired contest to see which group of misfits can seduce the most girls! And finally, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scandal, scare, skin, and screaminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hilarity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as a whole classroom of students discards common sense... just before they unwittingly discard their clothes! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fitting finish to a frenzied frolic in full-metal frivolity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and you definitely donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to miss it! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:783169fba84065d2dbc4e484b99cf7905abf1968","amp;dn":"FULL+METAL+PANIC+FUMOFFU+VOL+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"783169fba84065d2dbc4e484b99cf7905abf1968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,49,105,251,168,64,101,210,219,196,228,132,185,156,247,144,90,191,25,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
