At first glance, this village seems merely quaint -- hilariously so, in fact. With eccentrics right and left, such as a couple who practice sucking the rampant mosquitoes out of the air with a massive vacuum tube and several rowdy cadres of soused hunters, the work recalls Errol Morris' Vernon, Florida (1982) and Gates of Heaven (1978). But as the film rolls on, a darker undercurrent emerges from the town -- the truth that it housed a Communist-run concentration camp, and that several of its citizens (guards for the plant) are cold-blooded murderers by virtue of their jobs. In time, Paounov adds more gravitas still, by exploring the issue of one guard who was convicted of manslaughter at the camp -- and who also just happens to be a loving wife and mother.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:890e84ef01d8c71c09519f2942255b0a35d1bcbe","amp;dn":"The+Mosquito+problem+and+other+stories+%28english+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"890e84ef01d8c71c09519f2942255b0a35d1bcbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,14,132,239,1,216,199,28,9,81,159,41,66,37,91,10,53,209,188,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
