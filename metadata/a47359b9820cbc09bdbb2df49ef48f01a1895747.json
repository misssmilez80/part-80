Both are easy. \nI have it up and running as a virtual machine as the xVM VirtualBox has a specific setting for OS2 Warp4. \nOS2 has a reputation for not running in virtual mode but it runs fine on the Sun xVM machine.\n\nFor people with the xVM VirtualBox you may like to try Puppy4 (a7z file). Its a torrent that is the xVM hard disk image of an installed copy of the latest version of Puppy Linux.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a47359b9820cbc09bdbb2df49ef48f01a1895747","amp;dn":"OS2+Warp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a47359b9820cbc09bdbb2df49ef48f01a1895747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,115,89,185,130,12,188,9,189,187,45,244,158,244,143,1,161,137,87,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
