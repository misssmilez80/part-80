King, director of the recently-collapsed Franklin Community Federal Credit Union in Omaha and a prominent local political figure. Two grand juries ruled the allegations to be false and two purported victims were indicted for perjury[2] (one was convicted and sentenced to 9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“15 years in prison[3]) though numerous conspiracy theories persisted afterwards.[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c038132cb33abdf4aed2ff21b6711f5c968afabd","amp;dn":"Conspiracy+of+Silence+%28Banned+Discovery+Channel+Doc%29+1_6.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c038132cb33abdf4aed2ff21b6711f5c968afabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,56,19,44,179,58,189,244,174,210,255,33,182,113,31,92,150,138,250,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
