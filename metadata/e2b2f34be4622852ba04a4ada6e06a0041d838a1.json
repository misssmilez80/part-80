The former singer Brian Ross was replaced by Lou Taylor who was in Satan once before and himself was also, ironically, replaced by Brian Ross. After they released ''Out Of Reach'' they changed their name back to Satan and Michael Jackson joined on vocals. In 1988, the band changed it's name again, this time to The Kindred and then to Pariah (UK). They recorded three more albums and then quit. They announced a reunion with Brian Ross in 2005.\n\nExclusive Compilation Appearances:\n&quot;Oppression&quot; - Roxcalibur Sampler\n&quot;The Executioner&quot; - Roxcalibur Sampler\n\nDiscography\n\n\nThe First Demo \tDemo, 1981\t\nInto the Fire \tDemo, 1982\t\nKiss of Death \tSingle, 1982\t\t[1 review, 96%]\nCourt in the Act \tFull-length, 1983\t\t[4 reviews, average 97%]\nDirt Demo '86 \tDemo, 1986\t\nInto the Future \tEP, 1987\t\t[2 reviews, average 87%]\nSuspended Sentence \tFull-length, 1987\t\t[1 review, 86%]\nBlitzkrieg In Holland \tLive album, 2000\t\nLive in the Act \tLive album, 2004\t\n\n\nSatan (UK) - Live in the Act\n\nLive album, Metal Nation\nOctober 2004 \t\n[add/edit review] \t\nShow recorded in Dynamo Clube - Eindhoven (HOL), november, 1983.\nPlus 1981/1982 rare tracks.\n1.\tTrial by Fire\t05:00\t[view lyrics]\n2.\tNo Turning Back\t04:42\t[view lyrics]\n3.\tHeads Will Roll\t03:15\t[view lyrics]\n4.\tHunt You Down\t03:45\t[view lyrics]\n5.\tPull the Trigger\t09:55\t[view lyrics]\n6.\tBreaking Free\t05:49\t[view lyrics]\n7.\tBlades of Steel\t05:31\t[view lyrics]\n8.\tThe Ritual\t04:58\t[view lyrics]\n9.\tKiss of Death\t07:28\t[view lyrics]\n10.\tOpression\t06:22\t[view lyrics]\n11.\tThe Executioner\t03:37\t[view lyrics]\n12.\tBlitzkrieg\t03:41\t[view lyrics]\n13.\tDynamo\t04:36\t[view lyrics]\n14.\tKiss of Death\t05:00\t[view lyrics]\n15.\tHeads Will Roll\t03:11\t[view lyrics]\nTotal playing time\t01:16:50\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b2f34be4622852ba04a4ada6e06a0041d838a1","amp;dn":"Satan-++Live+in+the+Act+-+Geophagus+Rare+Stuff+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b2f34be4622852ba04a4ada6e06a0041d838a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,178,243,75,228,98,40,82,186,4,164,173,166,224,106,0,65,216,56,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
