My PC crashed and when I went to download these again, the torrent was down to 0 seeds.  Finally, there was 1 seed and I was able to get these again.  All I did was add album 50 and change the directory names so you would know what order to listen to the episodes - thank you to the orignal ripper.\n\nAlbums 0-15 are from the remastered Gold Audio series - I haven't been able to find the original versions, but the main difference between the two is that parents were complaining about how dumb Harlow Doyle, Private I was, so they made some changes.  They also changed the intro's and outro's a li'l'.\n\nYou can hear the latest episodes at Odyssey's homepage, www.whitsend.org - enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb08471176fa2978e9b57507a9a01c8e5498bbe5","amp;dn":"Focus+On+the+Family+-+Adventures+in+Odyssey+%28albums+0-48%2B50%2Bextr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb08471176fa2978e9b57507a9a01c8e5498bbe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,8,71,17,118,250,41,120,233,181,117,7,169,160,28,142,84,152,187,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
