Loren Battle is without a doubt one of the fastest rising unsigned bands in recent memory. Independently selling over 5,000 copies of both records and having over 40,000 hits on their Cover of Lady Gaga's &quot;Paparazzi&quot; and reaching 1 on the MySpace Metalcore charts on numerous occasions, Loren Battle shows no signs of slowing down. With tour plans in motion for the majority of 2011, and a new full-length in the works, expect to see a lot more of Loren Battle in the near future.\n\nAlbum: Learning to Live With Open Wounds\nBand: Loren Battle\n\n Tracklist:                                                                  |\n|                                                                            |\n|   01  Lost the Overture                                  00:47             |\n|   02  Learning To Live With Open Wounds                  03:36             |\n|   03  here's To You                                      03:32             |\n|   04  Deer In the Headlights                             04:29             |\n|   05  The Protester                                      04:33             |\n|   06  As We Collapse                                     02:04             |\n|   07  Reminiscent of the Dying                           04:02             |\n|   08  Heart Is For the Honest                            04:39             |\n|   09  Fairy Tale of the Apocalypse                       15:18             |\n|                                                                            |\n|                                                 RUNTIME: 43:00 min  \n\n\nPLEASE SEEEDD!!!\n\n\nFACEBOOK USERS!!!\nPLEASE!- search ownage5557 (TPB) and \\&quot;like\\&quot; my page to get informed as to when i upload new music and to request any album new or old! i can get any albums.
