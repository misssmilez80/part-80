(we have a new one now.)\nThis is a map that had 9737 different names of people log into this server.  So it's the perfect map to wonder around on single-player for hours looking at thousand's of people's hours of work.  Or you can start a server, duplicating mine.  all my server mods are even included in the pack!\nif you do host a server, post it here to get more players: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.13-thirtyseven.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.13-thirtyseven.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=5&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo this is a great map for building inspiration, or marveling for hours.  I fell down on keeping stuff pretty near the end, so there are most likly some pretty ugly structures near spawn now, but it shouldn't be too bad.\n\nThe map is around 450 MB uncompressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF README:\n\nfor singleplayer:\n\njust copy the &quot;world&quot; folder into your singleplayer saves.  stored here:\n%appdata%/.minecraft/saves\n\nfor multiplayer:\n\nthis server ran bukkit.\nI have included all the mods i had installed.\nto get bukkit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar&lt;/a&gt;\ndownload that, put it in the folder where this file is, and run.\nIf you want all the old players to keep their inventories, i have included everyone's inventories in a 7z file.  Just un-7z it into a folder named &quot;players&quot;\nI have also included everyone's login password, but to protect people's lives, it is in a password-protected 7z-file.  If you REALLY want to clone the old server, you can ask for it here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.13-thirtyseven.com/showthread.php?tid=562&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.13-thirtyseven.com/showthread.php?tid=562&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfor more info &amp; help: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.13-thirtyseven.com/showthread.php?tid=562&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.13-thirtyseven.com/showthread.php?tid=562&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fc1ba3c3641b5dc7b1a28a04b8eb75f7cccc4e9","amp;dn":"minecraft-+13-thirtyseven.com+1000+player+map","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fc1ba3c3641b5dc7b1a28a04b8eb75f7cccc4e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,193,186,60,54,65,181,220,123,26,40,160,75,142,183,95,124,204,196,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
