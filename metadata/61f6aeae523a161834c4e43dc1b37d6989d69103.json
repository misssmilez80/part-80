Traveling there in hope of getting good money, they arrive only to learn soon that El Guapo is not an actor, but a cruel gang leader suppressing people. He abducts the mayor's beautiful daughter Carmen (to be his wife) in revenge for the people's cry for help. Now, all hopes of the village folks rest on the weak shoulders of three minor-talented actors, who can't just walk off the set this time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio ~ 128 kbps\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo ~ 608x336\n\nSpoken ~ English\n\nSubs ~ None\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA DiabloDub rip means the highest standards on quality!
