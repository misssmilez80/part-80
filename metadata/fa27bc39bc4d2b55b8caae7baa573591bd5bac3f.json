Unfortunately, the scene with the turtle didn't turn out, so it was not included in the finished product.\n\nBut the show is solid, with or without a monkey or a turtle... A sampler:\n\nDerek Edwards: probably in the top ten funniest people in North America, and he's been around a while but most Canadians are STILL only starting to discover him. One would suspect a show could only go downhill after Derek, but...\n\nGreg Behrendt: relationship guru / author of 'He's Just Not That Into You' dishes it out, and it's delicious.\n\nRyan Belleville: even without a monkey, his manic, frantic comedy always delivers.\n\nPaula Poundstone: The laconic delivery is still there, the pantsuit still there, Paula is a veteran who's still got it.\n\nJ B Smoove: few performers can match his expressive physicality, and enthusiasm for the material. I get tired just watching him.\n\nJoan Rivers: erstwhile host of The Tonight Show (during Carson!), and the Queen of old-school, classic, top-notch comedy, who's not afraid of skewering anyone.\n\nTripod: one of my personal faves from this past year; Australia's kings of comedy music trios, and truly hilarious as the anchor to the show.\n\nSelfish favourite moment: the facial expressions of one-third of Tripod. You guess which guy I am referring to.\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa27bc39bc4d2b55b8caae7baa573591bd5bac3f","amp;dn":"Just+for+Laughs-The+Best+Of+JFL+Show+%233+%282008%29+CBC+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa27bc39bc4d2b55b8caae7baa573591bd5bac3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,39,188,57,188,77,43,85,184,202,174,123,170,87,53,145,189,91,172,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
