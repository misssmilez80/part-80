When compared to regular un-mastered stereo, it was (more or less) centered at a 60/40 ratio with slightly muffled high frequencies. The separate MONO channels were overdubbed twice in order to gain some of the &quot;fullness and depth&quot; when listened through the regular two-speaker stereo system.  \n\nThese sound differently from both, re-mastered and/or regular stereo.   \n\nNOTE: definitely NOT suitable for multi-speaker surround etc, sound systems!  \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03c4334a8d61becf4eb2a6bc9ab5ffdd2e3d2b3c","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Abbey+Road+%5BMONO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03c4334a8d61becf4eb2a6bc9ab5ffdd2e3d2b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,196,51,74,141,97,190,207,78,178,166,188,154,181,255,221,46,61,43,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
