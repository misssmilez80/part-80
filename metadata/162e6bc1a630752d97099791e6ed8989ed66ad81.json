Made in 1998, Pete Case reunited with guitarist Eddie Munoz and bassist Dave Pahoa, and recruited drummer Clem Burke (from Blondie!) to keep the beat.  These are great songs, and if you're a Plimsouls fan, this record is a rarity, and a real treat.\n\nI ripped this directly from the CD (bought it myself from their old http://www.lather.com/plimsouls/ website, which is no longer active) to 320k MP3, VBR.  It's pretty high quality, and great for an iPod.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1 - Playing With Jack\n2 - Feeling Strange\n3 - Down\n4 - Falling Awake\n5 - Pile Up\n6 - 12 O'Clock Midnight\n7 - Kool Trash\n8 - Lost\n9 - Dangerous Book\n10 - Not Of This World\n11 - Too Much Satisfaction\n\nShare and enjoy!
