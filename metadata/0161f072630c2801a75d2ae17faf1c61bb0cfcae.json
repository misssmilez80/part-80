The first, &quot;Falling Free,&quot; runs with a quick, crisp 4/4 dance beat amidst some fine guitar work from Garcia and higher-than-normal singing from Halliday. Things really kick in with &quot;Mission From God,&quot; mixing a haunting mock choir wash with a slow, sprawling wash of feedback and one of Halliday's most seductive, compelling vocals. &quot;Today is Not the Day,&quot; meanwhile, takes the moody ambient vibe of Doppelganger's &quot;Sandpit&quot; one step higher, resulting in a surprisingly effective ballad that combines mood and restrained power, not to mention a great final vocal hook. Add in a fine cover from the band's usual design team Flat Earth and Horror Head may well be the band's true lost classic. \n\n\n01 Horror Head (3:40)\n02 Falling Free (4:22)\n03 Mission from God (4:07)\n04 Today Is Not the Day (3:44)\n\n-----\n\nFrom Cuckoo's Nest, The Curve Archive:\n\nCURVE. &quot;HORROR HEAD&quot;\n\nall songs TONI HALLIDAY / DEAN GARCIA,\npublished by ANXIOUS MUSIC LTD / SONY MUSIC PUBLISHING LTD / VIRGIN MUSIC (PUBLISHING) LTD\n\nProduced by CURVE &amp; FLOOD.
