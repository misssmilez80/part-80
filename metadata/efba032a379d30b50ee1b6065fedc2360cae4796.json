Nine studio albums, thousands of live shows and nearly three decades into a career that's made them one of the biggest and most important Metal bands in the world, the members of Slayer know exactly what kind of music they make: brutal but beautiful, punishing yet precise. A fresh Slayer record is a thing of terror but also one of trust: You can depend on what you're getting even if you're unprepared for it. As guitarist Jeff Hanneman says, ''At this point, I think a Slayer album pretty much speaks for itself.''
