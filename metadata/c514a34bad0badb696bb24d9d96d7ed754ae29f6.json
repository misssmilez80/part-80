Ripped from DVD straight to AppleTV format. I also tried to keep it a decent size per file while maintaining nice resolution :)\n\nThese are all MP4 files so they can be played thru iTunes, Quicktimes or VLC on a regular PC or Mac. I made them in a format that is easily convertible to others such as AVI or XVID. Once again, even though they where ripped for an AppleTV they ARE playable on a PC. \n\n\n===============\nThe clock is ticking. \n\n&quot;Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. My wife and daughter have been kidnapped... and people that I work with may be involved in both. I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.&quot; \n- Jack Bauer\n===============\n\nFormat: AppleTV\nSource: DVD\nCodec: H.264, AAC\nResolution: 854x480\nBitrate: 1500 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c514a34bad0badb696bb24d9d96d7ed754ae29f6","amp;dn":"24+Season+1+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c514a34bad0badb696bb24d9d96d7ed754ae29f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,20,163,75,173,11,173,182,150,187,36,217,217,109,126,215,84,174,41,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
