It blends real-time strategy, city building and god game elements. It was released on October 7, 2005 as stated on the official Lionhead website, but to those who preordered it arrived on October 5, 2005 from most sources. The Mac OS X version, however, was not released until January 6, 2009 [2]. It is the sequel to 2001's Black &amp; White, also the brainchild of Peter Molyneux. The lead designers are Peter Molyneux and Ron Millar, who previously worked at Blizzard Entertainment on titles such as StarCraft and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness.\n\nThe concept of the game is that the player is a god, called from heaven to help those who invoked them. However, the player is not an omnipotent monotheistic style god, but rather a god who rises and falls with his believers and the player must help develop their nature according to their good or evil desires. The player also has a creature, their physical representation in the world, which takes the form of an anthropomorphic ape, lion, wolf or cow and, with an unlocker, a tiger. It can grow to an immense size, and adopt a good or evil persona separate of the player's. They develop their character as the player rewards or punishes their actions.\n\nIn addition to the god simulation and city-building elements of the original Black &amp; White, Black &amp; White 2 also features elements of Real-Time Strategy gameplay, with the addition of controllable warfare and fighting units.\n\nBlack &amp; White 2 also features a more conventional HUD (Heads-Up Display) system than its predecessor. Rather than the experimental HUDless gameplay seen in the original game, Black &amp; White 2 features HUD notifications that inform players of their creature's state of mind, the effects of their actions on their creature, the status of villages, etc.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows 2000/XP,\nIntel-compatible 1.6 GHz CPU,\n512MB RAM,\n3.5GB hard drive space,\n8x DVD-ROM,\nDirectX 9.0c compatible hardware,\nand a 64MB video card with 1.1 Pixel Shader support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20968cde52b782de8b8a9c6ef836721c7e0abb92","amp;dn":"Black+And+White+2+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20968cde52b782de8b8a9c6ef836721c7e0abb92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,150,140,222,82,183,130,222,139,138,156,110,248,54,114,28,126,10,187,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
