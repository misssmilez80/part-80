And things will start to change. But I always knew that before that could happen there would need to be a change in the air to make it even possible. While going through the clips you hear towards the end of this video I got the strong impression that it's actually happening. It will still be a while before we get full acceptance, and the disgusting behaviour of SOME religious people becomes socially unacceptable, but I feel for the first time that I might just live to see it.\n\nTo all those who have got us THIS far, please, keep going, keep pushing. The immovable object is not where it was just a few years ago. I never imagined I would see atheists coming together in the real world, seeking each other out. I didn't think the hunger was there. It is. You're not alone. You never were.\n\nby philhellenes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021f2206461c2885c984acf8ffa1f2db5637a887","amp;dn":"Christians+Can%5C%27t+Read+Atheist+Billboards+by+philhellenes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021f2206461c2885c984acf8ffa1f2db5637a887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,31,34,6,70,28,40,133,201,132,172,248,255,161,242,219,86,55,168,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
