Included in the gameplay are numerous occasions in which the player can alter other character\\\\\\'s attitudes and reactions depending upon responses and actions (or inactions). Dubbed \\\\\\&quot;UberVariables\\\\\\&quot;, certain decisions made by the player can set them along one of three tracks: Paranoia (Willmore will start seeing things like twitching corpses and shadowy figures), Loss (messages from his ex-wife are kinder), and \\\\\\&quot;The X-Track\\\\\\&quot; (more details are revealed about mytharc-related conspiracies). The player can also affect Willmore\\\\\\'s relationship with Astadourian positively and negatively based upon \nhow he responds to her suggestions and ideas.\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe game takes place somewhere within the timeline of the third season of The X-Files series. The story follows a young Seattle-based FBI agent named Craig Willmore (played by Jordan Lee Williams) who is assigned by Assistant Director Walter Skinner to investigate the disappearance of agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who were last seen in the Everett, Washington area. Agent Willmore must use his state-of-the-art spy tools: night vision goggles, a digital camera, PDA (an Apple Newton), lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue handgun, handcuffs and badge, to follow their trail. Along the way, he is partnered with a Seattle Police Department detective named Mary Astadourian (played by Paige Witte) and a minor subplot involves a relationship developing between the two.\n\n[wikipedia.com]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f73861e53b6edec8e53e6cd280658bd991eceb","amp;dn":"The+X-Files+%5BPC-Game%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f73861e53b6edec8e53e6cd280658bd991eceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,247,56,97,229,59,110,222,200,229,62,108,210,128,101,139,217,145,236,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
