It's about a band of rogue DJs that captivated Britain, playing the music that defined a generation and standing up to a government that, incomprehensibly, preferred jazz. The Count, a big, brash, American god of the airwaves; Quentin, the boss of Radio Rock -- a pirate radio station in the middle of the North Sea that's populated by an eclectic crew of rock and roll DJs; Gavin, the greatest DJ in Britain who has just returned from his drug tour of America to reclaim his rightful position; Dave, an ironic, intelligent and cruelly funny co-broadcaster; and a fearsome British government official out for blood against the drug takers and lawbreakers of a once-great nation.\n\n\n\nScreenShots\n[img]http://imgshack.info/images/ryz6vxxwmdk4vf9w5j7t.png[/img]\n[img]http://imgshack.info/images/4rl258keeoxlpsrut55r.png[/img]\n[img]http://imgshack.info/images/8vgukf8vbhrzyqti7f.png[/img]\n[img]http://imgshack.info/images/it98i0lwhr0nq5fy3oyb.jpg[/img]Pictures and details\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b2bac919e30e4bfc1891cf560e2e4624681d7fe","amp;dn":"Pirate+Radio+2009+HQ.R5-XVID+%5BClear+Copy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b2bac919e30e4bfc1891cf560e2e4624681d7fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,43,172,145,158,48,228,191,193,137,28,245,96,226,228,98,70,129,215,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
