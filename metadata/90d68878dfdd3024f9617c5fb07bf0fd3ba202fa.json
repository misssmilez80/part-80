If you have the ability to run encode-handheld.pl then do it.\n\nHmmm. I should of added artwork support, opps.\n\nWell if you want artwork then do this\n\ngo to AtomicParsley variables and make new one\n\nset artwork=c:\\path\\to\\your\\artwork.jpg\n\nGo to the end of the first long AtomicParsley-utf8 line\n\nafter\n \n--tracknum %tracknum%\n\nappend \n\n--artwork &quot;%artwork%&quot;\n\n\nThe batch file isn't setting stik\n\nAdd this to the AtomicParsley call before the --overWrite\n\n--stik &quot;%stik%&quot;\n\n\nThis batch script will not properly handle down mixing of DTS audio to stereo.  The center channel audio will be pushed to the right channel.  That is a flaw with ffmpeg that no developer has addressed yet sadly.  Refer to posts below for a work around regarding this.\n\nPlease use the spreadsheet included to help you determine proper sizing.  Input original dimensions into spreadsheet.  It will give you the width, height, AR, crop values to use in the script.  Use the PSP line (480 width) for the values in the batch script.  You can get the original dimensions by using mediainfo or just typing ffmpeg -i filename and then reading the results.\n\nYou can of course use this script to make larger than the standard 480x272 encodes.  You should adjust the bitrate however to accommodate for that.  You can use the other iPod lines in the spreadsheet.  For the largest iPod dimensions you should use a bitrate of around 1152kb (compared to 384 for PiZ).\n\n\n-HR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d68878dfdd3024f9617c5fb07bf0fd3ba202fa","amp;dn":"HR+basic+Windows+PiZ+encoding+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d68878dfdd3024f9617c5fb07bf0fd3ba202fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,214,136,120,223,221,48,36,249,97,124,95,176,123,240,253,59,162,2,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
