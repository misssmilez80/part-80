Fearing ridicule by association, Jackie sets up a date for reluctant Donna with Michael's elder ex-con brother Casey, just out of military service, a political mismatch but a hit at first sight, who reminds Eric 'Foreplay' he's still a measly nobody and lost Donna. Fez can think of nothing but fat Rhonda's promise to 'share something' with him, so he gets Leo's permission to use the Photohut and Kitty's advice 'for a friend' about 'doing it', but Rhonda feels because she loves him best...

Vicious 'girlfriend' Jackie shows her jealous nature by first pretending it's not true, then it's not important, finally trying to make him give it up 'because modeling is her dream', and when that fails turning to her Cheese Palace boss, Todd. Fez begged till Hyde gave him a driving lesson in his El Camino, but by the time he gets to drive a few meter- that's too far, being backward, so the rear section is damaged to the tune of $80; Leo, who stood there, lands in hospital, where he enjoys Kitty's care so much he continues to woo her after his discharge, while she feels that doesn't annoy Red enough. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 4, Episode 19: Jackie's Cheese Squeeze\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½26 February 2002\n\nJackie kisses Todd, a colleague of her, and Eric accidentally sees it. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 4, Episode 20: Class Picture\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½19 March 2002\n\nWhen their class is having their pictures taken for the yearbook, Kelso concentrates on his coy look, but Jackie insists a meaningful personal quote is even more important.
