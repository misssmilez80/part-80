Save time and stay organized in every step of your workflow with ACDSee Pro.\n\nManage, view, process, and publish your images\n\n\nThe new Manage, View, Process, and Online modes simplify and accelerate your photography workflow, allowing you to easily access the features you need and publish your images. In Process mode, use the non-destructive developing capabilities along with the editing tools with which ACDSee Pro users are familiar. Previously, ACDSee Pro users could only access the RAW Processor if they had a RAW image. Now in ACDSee Pro 3, you can take any file format (RAW, JPEG), and perform all of your non-destructive developing in Process mode.\n Manage mode\n\nBrowse, sort, and organize in Manage mode. The simplified toolbar with drop-down menus help you to find the most commonly used tasks. You can combine different tools and panes to perform sophisticated search, and view thumbnail previews of images. Usability improvements include radio buttons for ratings, and category check boxes to quickly categorize images. Publish your images easily using the FTP, Email, SmugMug, or Zenfolio uploaders.\n    View mode\n\nView your images using a variety of image viewing tools. Use the Properties pane to display image information such as EXIF or IPTC data, and add captions to your images as you view them. View mode features a new filmstrip, which lets you easily flip between images without having to return to Manage mode.\n    Process mode\n\nPerform all image adjustments in Process mode. The Process mode has two panes: Develop and Edit. Use the Develop pane for non-destructive editing on RAW, JPEG and other supported file types. Use tools in Develop to adjust an image's exposure, white balance, color profile, sharpen, and much more. Use Edit to fine tune your image using pixel-based editing tools such as red eye removal.\n    Online mode\n\nUse Online mode to upload your images to the new online image sharing and storage site: ACDSee Online. In Online mode, you can easily drag and drop your photos into an album on ACDSee Online without having to go through a Web site.\nRevolutionary New Process Mode\n\nIn Process mode, you can perform a variety of image corrections (tune color and light, enhance details, crop) in real time without waiting for an adjustment to apply on an image. You can view at any time the final image with and without each adjustment to view the effects of your changes, and return to each adjustment to further fine tune your image.\nDevelop and Edit\n\nACDSee Pro 3 Process mode is a combination of non-destructive image correction tools in Develop, with pixel editing tools easily accessible in Edit.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e4e0299511a40bbf0c0b323d41a11238224f85a","amp;dn":"Acdsee.Pro.v3.0.355.Incl.Keymaker-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e4e0299511a40bbf0c0b323d41a11238224f85a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,78,2,153,81,26,64,187,240,192,179,35,212,26,17,35,130,36,248,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
