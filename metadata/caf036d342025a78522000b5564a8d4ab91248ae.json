The series ran until Volume 5 on the PlayStation, covering various games from the \n\nlate 1980s.\n\nNamco museum vol. 1 released on november 22, 1995\n\nThis was the first in the long series for the PlayStation and contains Pac-Man (1980), Rally-X (1980), New Rally-X (1981), \n\nGalaga (1981), Pole Position (1982), Bosconian (1981) and Toy Pop (1986).\nAll of the games were ported from the original arcade version's source code ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Galaga allowed for an alternative \n\nscreenmode to compensate for the lack of vertical monitor, whereby the scoreboard was located on the left of the screen, \n\nor rotated the image 90 degrees if the user possessed a vertical monitor or was willing to risk placing the \n\ntelevision/monitor on its side. Pac-Man allowed the same. The games in Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary Arcade \n\nCollection were emulated using the original game ROMs.\n\nNamco museum vol. 2 released on february 9, 1996 (Western Version)\n\nThe second installment of the PlayStation series features Mappy (1983), Xevious (1982), Galaga sequel Gaplus (1984), \n\nGrobda (1984) (a Xevious &quot;spinoff&quot;), Dragon Buster (1984) and Super Pac-Man (1982) (in western versions), and Cutie Q \n\n(1979) (in the Japanese version). Although Cutie Q is only playable in the Japanese version, its code can be found on the \n\nAmerican release of this compilation. It enjoyed similar success to the original, and contained a similar &quot;museum&quot; mode. \n\nThe Japanese version also features Bomb Bee (1979) as a hidden game. There is a glitch in this volume where in Dragon \n\nBuster the Hi-score is not saved properly. It is shown in the Record Book, but does not appear in-game. The default Hi-\n\nscore is 10,000.\n\nNamco museum vol. 3 released on june 21, 1996\n\nThe third PlayStation volume contains Galaxian (1979), Dig Dug (1982), Pac-Man sequel Ms. Pac-Man (1981), Pole Position \n\nII (1983), The Tower of Druaga (1984) and Phozon (1983). The first four were well-known in the U.S., but the latter two were \n\nrelatively unknown. It contained the now-customary museum mode. Two unique versions of The Tower of Druaga were \n\nalso hidden in this volume. One called &quot;Another Tower&quot;, and the other called &quot;Darkness Tower&quot;. Both are harder than the \n\noriginal and require different methods to beat the game.\n\nNamco museum vol. 4 released on november 8, 1996\n\nVolume 4 for the PlayStation features Pac-Land (1984), Assault (1988), Ordyne (1988), the sequel to The Tower of Druaga \n\nknown as The Return of Ishtar (1986) Genpei Toma Den (1986), and Assault Plus (1988) as a hidden game. The usual \n\nmuseum mode was included. Genpei Toma Den was renamed &quot;Genji and the Heike Clans&quot; in this collection.\n\nNamco museum vol. 5 released on february 28, 1997\n\nVolume 5 for the PlayStation features Pac-Mania (1987), Dragon Spirit (1987), Metro-Cross (1985), Baraduke (1985) and \n\nValkyrie No Densetsu (1989), as well as the standard museum mode. Valkyrie No Densetsu was renamed &quot;Legend of the \n\nValkyrie&quot; in this collection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf036d342025a78522000b5564a8d4ab91248ae","amp;dn":"Namco+Museum+Vol.1-2-3-4-5%5BPSX-5+CD-PAL-ENG-ISO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf036d342025a78522000b5564a8d4ab91248ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,240,54,211,66,2,90,120,82,32,0,181,86,74,141,74,185,18,72,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
