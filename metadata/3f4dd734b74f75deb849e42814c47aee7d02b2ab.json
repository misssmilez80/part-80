But, it would take about two months for the places to tell me they couldn't because all were sold out. Oh, well. I found other means to attain this cool music. I know little about this fellow other than he is a good German electronic artist, mixing in guitars and strange synth. This is pretty much what he has put out. The only mystery I have is what the 'downstairs' album is. It contains tracks from other albums, but some that aren't. I can find no-info on it. One lady I talked to from Vienna seemed to know very much about it, but our conversation wasn't very contructive seeing as how I speak about 5 words in German. Anyway here it is ,again, for your enjoyment :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f4dd734b74f75deb849e42814c47aee7d02b2ab","amp;dn":"Alien+Skull+Paint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f4dd734b74f75deb849e42814c47aee7d02b2ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,77,215,52,183,79,117,222,184,73,228,40,20,196,122,238,125,2,178,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
