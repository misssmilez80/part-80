In the Czech Republic he receives an anonymous gift: a phone which sends messages that enable him to win at a casino. Max soon finds himself pursed by hit men, the casino's security chief, and a CIA operative. Who's sending Max messages? Previous recipients of similar windfalls have ended up dead. After a couple of close scrapes, Max realizes he's in danger, so he tries to find out the root of the conspiracy - which seems to have access to every security camera in the world - before he's the next victim. Why is this happening to him, and who can he trust?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7b738bac5ab77a52c416f9264f3e90aecec57f","amp;dn":"Echelon+Conspiracy.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7b738bac5ab77a52c416f9264f3e90aecec57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,123,115,139,172,90,183,122,82,196,22,249,38,79,62,144,174,206,197,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
