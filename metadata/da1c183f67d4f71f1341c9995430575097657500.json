For Jack, it's even worse. Where he lives, superheroes are a common sight, flying through the air and showing off their outrageous muscles in skintight outfits. In comparison, a regular guy must seem really boring and puny. Imagine his surprise when the cute girl on the subway agrees to go out with him! But as a reporter for a major superpowers magazine, is Nora really as unimpressed by the flying heroes as she professes? And how would she react if she knew the amazing secret of Jack's cat?\n\nWritten and illustrated by Andi Watson.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1c183f67d4f71f1341c9995430575097657500","amp;dn":"Love+Fights+%28Oni+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1c183f67d4f71f1341c9995430575097657500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,28,24,63,103,212,247,31,19,65,201,153,84,48,87,80,151,101,117,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
