Later it went through many changes and was released as Genma Onimusha (?? ????) for the Xbox in 2002. The game was also ported to PC Windows as Onimusha: Warlords, although this version was only released in Asia and Russia.\n\nStory\n\nThe game features samurai Samanosuke Akechi (modeled after actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, also credited as the game's &quot;guest creator&quot;), determined to save Princess Yuki of the Saito clan and defeat the warlord Oda Nobunaga, resurrected after signing a pact with yokai demons. The game also features Kaede, a female ninja who provides Samanosuke with help. They both travel throughout all of Inabayama Castle, where they find special weapons and solve various puzzles as they search for clues of Princess Yuki's whereabouts.\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay in the game is similar to that of Capcom's Resident Evil series, but with an emphasis on close-range combat.\n\nThe player begins the game with a standard katana sword, and can also obtain long range weapons with limited supply. However, as the player progresses, Samanosuke can gain three elemental weapons: Raizan, Enyuu and Shippuu, each with an elemental magic attack. As enemies are defeated, they release different coloured souls that are absorbed by using the demon gauntlet on Samanosuke's wrist: red souls act as a sort of &quot;currency&quot; which can be used for upgrading weaponry, yellow souls recover health, while blue souls recover magic power which is used to perform each weapon's elemental abilities.\n\nSome sections are played with Samanosuke's assistant, Kaede, who has her own array of weapons and abilities, but is unable to absorb souls.\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nSupported OS: Windows 2000/XP\nProcessor: Pentium III 1GHz, AMD Athlon 1 GHz (or better)\nRAM: 256 MB of RAM (1 GB Recommended)\nVideo Card: 128 MB DirectX 9.0c-compliant AGP or PCI Express graphics card (256 MB or higher for High Graphics Detail support) (see supported list*)\nSound Card: DirectX 9.0c-compliant sound card (or better)\nDirectX Version: DirectX 9.0c or higher (Direct X 9.0c included on disk)\nCD-ROM: 12x or faster CD-ROM\nHard Drive Space: 2 GB minimum\nPeripherals Supported: Gamepad and headset\n\n*Supported Video Cards at Time of Release\nGeforce FX/6/7 Families\nRadeon 9500-9800/X Families (x200 NOT supported) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab55c632c1d96494c7f3cc8c085623ec02c5159f","amp;dn":"Onimusha+Warlords+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab55c632c1d96494c7f3cc8c085623ec02c5159f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,85,198,50,193,217,100,148,199,243,204,140,8,86,35,236,2,197,21,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
