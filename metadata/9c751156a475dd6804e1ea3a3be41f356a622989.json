An icon to a generation of rockers, he still writes songs that span the broad emotional and musical spectrum; his originals, notably the satirical &quot;Ever Since I Stole the Blues&quot; and a comical rumination on mortality titled &quot;Was,&quot; join his cover of the standard &quot;Your Red Wagon&quot; to reveal that after thirty years the hep cat's message still brings it home. ~ Frank John Hadley 1993 \n\nMose Allison - My Backyard Tracks:\n01  Ever Since I Stole the Blues  \n02  You Call It Joggin'  \n03  Big Brother  \n04  Sentimental Fool  \n05  Stranger in My Own Hometown  \n06  Was  \n07  Gettin' Paid Waltz  \n08  Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde  \n09  That's Your Red Wagon  \n10  Long Song  \n11  Sleepy Lagoon  \n12  My Backyard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c751156a475dd6804e1ea3a3be41f356a622989","amp;dn":"Mose+Allison+-+My+Backyard+%281989%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c751156a475dd6804e1ea3a3be41f356a622989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,117,17,86,164,117,221,104,4,225,234,58,59,228,31,53,106,98,41,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
