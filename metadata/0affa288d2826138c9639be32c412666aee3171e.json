A code of fourteen numbers and a single phone call can trigger them any moment - this is the Apocalypse Code. An agent of the Russian FSB Darya Vyacheslavovna (Anastasya Zavorotnyuk) infiltrates the terrorist organization and vitnesses the killing of Jaffad, who at his last breath tells her that the code has been divided to three trusted persons. Jaffad's partner &quot;The Executioner&quot; /Palach/ is determined to find them and trigger the nukes, so is Darya - to prevent it. They both begin their search for the code around the world, whereas one cannot harm another - they both have parts of it which the other doesn't.\n\nRussian Language\nDVD RIP\nEnglish Sub Titles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0affa288d2826138c9639be32c412666aee3171e","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Code+2007+%5BRUS%5D%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0affa288d2826138c9639be32c412666aee3171e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,255,162,136,210,130,97,56,201,99,155,227,44,65,38,102,174,227,23,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
