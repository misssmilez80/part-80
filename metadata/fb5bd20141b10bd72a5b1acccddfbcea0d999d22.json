Downloading also means uploading, and the amounts of each are linked, to ensure fairness and rapidity in the spread of the file at hand.\n\nTo be able to download a file, you first need to get the associated .torrent file. This file, usually a dozen KB in size, is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsignatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the much bigger file to be downloaded, and it needs special software to be read properly. Azureus is one of those types of software.\n\nIf you want to host files yourself, you need a tracker, which is basically a central server coordinating the connections between peers.\nAzureus can provide a tracker too.\n\nYou will find, as you discover its functionality, that it is easy to customize your copy of Azureus to exactly fit your needs.\n\n\nED2K Link:\ned2k://|file|Vuze_4.2.0.4_macosx.dmg|10895360|218D848960EB3BBB478D1DC2FDB95A5B|h=Q5JICA5U74BJIQNJSOUCQGSNLP6W2WB7|/\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n   \nNew Features:\n\nCore | Subscription options for auto-starting auto-downloads\n\nCore | Support for sharing .vuze files\n\nCore | Added support for adding categories to transcoded content\n\nCore | Added default transcode dir option\n\nCore | Support for keep-alive and more gzip on web contexts\n\nCore | Added percentage complete and eta to content descriptor\n\nUIvz | UI displays while core initializes\n\nPlug | Plugin interface to the search functionality\n\n\nChanges:\n\nCore | Added another non-standard RSS date format\n\nCore | Allow HTTP seeding for simple torrents without knowledge of file name\n\nCore | Keep log files open rather than continually opening and closing them\n\nCore | Improved reporting of 'no disk space' errors for FAT32\n\nCore | Improved logging performance\n\nCore | Support for updated via installer as opposed to incremental updates\n\n\nCorrected bugs:\n\nCore | Work around for broken socket handling on freebsd7.x\n\nCore | Recover from borked transcode queue config\n\nCore | Fix xml stats export with undefined characters\n\nCore | Support &gt;2GB resource downloads\n\nCore | Fixed HTTP seeding when switching content on a keep-alive connection\n\nCore | Fix tracker announcer to pay attention to user options correctly\n\nCore | Multi-file torrents were borked in content directory\n\n\nUI | Set speeds in bits/sec when bits/sec display is selected\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5bd20141b10bd72a5b1acccddfbcea0d999d22","amp;dn":"Vuze+4.2.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5bd20141b10bd72a5b1acccddfbcea0d999d22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,91,210,1,65,177,11,215,42,91,26,204,205,223,188,234,13,153,157,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
