They were at their sexiest when they were at their ugliest; they were at their most cathartic when they were at their most claustrophobic; they were at their sleekest when they were at their most layered. Curve were also, in a roundabout and involuntary way, considerate: had they been more concerned with melodies and a little less so with textures, Garbage wouldn't have been necessary -- in turn, that later band's members would have less money in the bank. Curve's blurred textures, created in part by guitars subjected to a battery of effects, led to frequent classification as shoegaze, but their sound -- reliant on pounding/driving/pulsing rhythms generated by both machines and humans -- put you in a chokehold, not a daze. There were steady torrents of vroom and oomph, and Toni Halliday's confrontational lyrics and vocals were more likely to pierce through the din than melt into the background. They were certainly dark and yet were hardly goth; they were set up like a rock band but were essentially a dance band. The Way of Curve is the most representative of the band not for its set of wise selections, but for the fact that it's as difficult to classify as the band itself. It lands somewhere between a beginning and an end, not quite a proper beginner's guide while falling short of being a gap plugger for those seeking all the elusive B-sides. The first disc, covering the band's first A-side through its most recent recordings, does include many of the best moments, but a few essential tracks are neglected in favor of too much later, lesser material. (Right around the major-label comeback single, 1997's &quot;Chinese Burn,&quot; it became evident that the musical climate had finally caught up with them.) &quot;Pink Girl With the Blues,&quot; a low-key, independent-label comeback single from 1996, is one of the most significant inclusions, since many longtime fans have gone years without ever hearing it. Storming and seething, it rightfully belongs on this first disc, pitting Throbbing Gristle/Moroder-like percolations against a kinetic, snarling flurry of guitars. The second disc rifles through B-sides and obscurities, beginning with &quot;On the Wheel.&quot; That song is Curve's own &quot;Erotic City&quot; -- meaning it's a B-side that many justifiably regard as the band's apex -- and you don't have to actually see The Doom Generation to know that the scene in which the song is used must be the best one in any Gregg Araki-directed film. There are negligible choices made with the remainder of this second disc as well, the greatest miscue being the favoring of the Aphex Twin mix of &quot;Falling Free&quot; over the far superior original. Even with these flaws, The Way of Curve provides plenty for any form of fan. \n\n01 Ten Little Girls (4:28)\n02 Coast Is Clear (3:59)\n03 Clipped (3:51)\n04 Die Like a Dog (4:39)\n05 Horror Head (3:41)\n06 Fait Accompli (4:12)\n07 Missing Link (4:31)\n08 Superblaster (3:58)\n09 Pink Girl with the Blues (4:52)\n10 Recovery (4:31)\n11 Chinese Burn (4:49)\n12 Coming Up Roses (4:34)\n13 Hell Above Water (4:04)\n14 Want More Need Less (4:34)\n15 Perish (5:13)\n16 Nice and Easy (3:27)\n17 On the Wheel (6:02)\n18 Triumph (4:49)\n19 Arms Out (4:46)\n20 Sigh (3:49)\n21 Mission from God (4:07)\n22 Today Is Not the Day (3:38)\n23 Low and Behold (4:14)\n24 Nothing Without Me (3:11)\n25 What a Waste (4:58)\n26 Falling Free [Aphex Twin Mix] (7:40)\n27 Chinese Burn [Lunatic Calm Mix] (7:24)\n28 Coming Up Roses [Kevin Shields Mix] (6:14)\n29 I Feel Love (4:35)\n30 In Disguise (4:10)\n31 Sinner (5:09)\n\n-----\n\nFrom Cuckoo's Nest, The Curve Archive:\n\nCURVE. &quot;THE WAY OF CURVE 1990/2004&quot;\n\ndetailed credits (link to the official Curve site).\n\nSleeve design &amp; layout www.flatearth.co.uk\nFish images from the Tokyo fish market by Toni Summer 2003\nSleeve notes &amp; PR Phill Savidge www.savagepr.com\nRemastered by Kevin Metcalfe at The Soundmasters\nProject Coordinator - Charlie Stanford @ Blue Cube Consultancy.\n\nUK release (17 May 2004)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce2004edccad7b4138cb5cc72c919053ddc19d3","amp;dn":"Curve+-+The+Way+of+Curve+%282004%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce2004edccad7b4138cb5cc72c919053ddc19d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,226,0,78,220,202,215,180,19,140,181,204,114,201,25,5,61,220,25,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
