And use less electricity too! How? All computers suffer from fragmentation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where files are broken up and scattered all across your disk drives. This makes it take longer to read, write and save files. Plus since your PC is working harder than it needs to, more wear and tear occurs. Diskeeper with new IntelliWriteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ fragmentation prevention resolves this by preventing up to 85% of all fragmentation from happening in the first place. Any remaining fragmentation is quickly eliminated in real time thanks to DiskeeperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s InvisiTaskingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology. With new Diskeeper 2011 your computers simply run better than new all the time! Your computers will run faster with Diskeeper 2011 installed. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll enjoy using every aspect of your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from downloading to accessing files to surfing the web with greater ease and efficiency. \n\nLeave hang-times, freeze-ups and other fragmentation-based crashes in the dust.\n\n\nFile fragmentation on your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard drive is one of the most basic reasons for slows, hangs, crashes and system errors. Left alone, it will bring your computer to a halt. Fragmentation is continual and with the number of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s applications, peripherals, and file sizes, it accumulates hourly. No manual defragmenter will prevent this. Diskeeper 2011 is the only defragmenter ever built that defragments in real time without requiring a schedule. Your computer will run faster with Diskeeper 2011 installed - period.\n\nAvailable in Diskeeper 2011, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance. InvisiTaskingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology offers true transparent, background processing technology allows Diskeeper 2011 to defragment your computer in real-time, completely eliminating the need for cumbersome maintenance operations. Free up gridlocked resources and let your computer hum along at peak performance. Diskeeper 2011 Professional enhances the reliability and performance of your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½automatically! \n\nDiskeeper 2011 I-FAASTÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® file optimization technology accelerates file access times to meet the heavy workloads of file-intensive applications. Utilizing a specially formulated technology, I-FAAST closely monitors file usage and organizes the most commonly accessed files for the fastest possible access, boosting file access and creation to speeds above and beyond the capabilities of your system when it was new, up to 80% faster.  \n\nHigh-power computer systems require high power-defragmentation engines. Only Diskeeper 2011 includes the advanced technology necessary to eliminate large volume fragmentation found on big and busy computers. The remarkable Terabyte Volume EngineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ (TVE) technology. TVE is the only defrag technology with the necessary horsepower to eliminate the rapid fragmentation build-up that occurs in high-traffic volumes that handles millions of files. TVE was initially developed for the highest capacity servers but has now also become essential for the high end power user. Large databases, CAD programs -- Diskeeper 2011 handles the biggest jobs fast and thoroughly. The greater the number of files and fragments on a volume, the more dramatic TVE's benefits will be. Nothing compares to TVE's ability to eliminate enterprise level fragmentation. In a class of its own, TVE makes real-time power computer defragmentation a fact.\n\nCHANGES IN DISKEEPER 2011:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Efficiency. New technology and advanced algorithms maximize performance while eliminating disk I/O activity not conducive to improving your computing experience. Maximum performance from minimal effort!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Immediacy. With IntelliWrite continuing to prevent most fragmentation before it happens, the new Instant Defrag feature of Diskeeper now rapidly eliminates any fragmented data that does occur.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Scalability. With the immediate file-by-file approach to optimization, time and resource consuming whole-volume analysis and defragmentation operations are rarely, if ever, needed. This revolutionary new design scales to much larger volumes than traditional disk defragmentation technologies!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Defragmentation Options. Diskeeper now defaults to an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEfficientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ defragmentation method to maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing disk I/O by intelligently determining which files, folders and free space should be defragmented. This setting can be changed to a more extensive defragmentation option from the Defragmentation Options tab in the Configuration Properties.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Savings. Diskeeper now tracks I/OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saved on your system. Taking into account the I/O activity of Diskeeper as well, this cumulative net figure equates to less system processing overhead, disk head movement, and total power consumption resulting in reduced operating costs. Now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even easier to gauge the benefits of your new investment !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f912359e96c4c39e690f2ca05daf3b6bf5899ae5","amp;dn":"Diskeeper+2011+Pro+Premier+v15.0.956.0+%28x86-x64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f912359e96c4c39e690f2ca05daf3b6bf5899ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,18,53,158,150,196,195,158,105,15,44,160,93,175,59,107,245,137,154,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
