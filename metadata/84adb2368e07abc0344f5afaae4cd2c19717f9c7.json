There's something weird, though. In the original disc, the title song (&quot;Attack of the Saucerman&quot;) was not working correctly. But when I burned the disc image, the title song on that disc is working properly. But now, the original disc that I made an image of is no longer working. What's up with that?\n\nAlso, I tried the image on ePSXe. I tried all of the sound plug-ins, but apparently the music is not working. So, if you want to hear the music, it seems that you must have a modded Playstation in order to hear it.\n\nThis is a very rare game, so if you like it, please seed it. If you have something to say, don't hesitate to leave a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84adb2368e07abc0344f5afaae4cd2c19717f9c7","amp;dn":"%5BPSX%5D+Attack+of+the+Saucerman+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84adb2368e07abc0344f5afaae4cd2c19717f9c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,173,178,54,142,7,171,192,52,79,90,250,174,76,210,193,151,23,249,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
