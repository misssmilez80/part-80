The globalists intend to gain, through any available means, total dictatorial control over all the peoples of the world. They cannot realize their goal if their would-be enforcers (police and soldiers) refuse to assist them in their treachery. &quot;If police officers and soldiers will not enforce tyranny, it will never be enforced!&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://isohunt.com/release?poster=InfoCourier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://isohunt.com/release?poster=InfoCourier&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbec4d0f3869c17fc415d810cf96159c7dd8d340","amp;dn":"Officer+Jack+Mclamb+Program+-+July+12%2C+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbec4d0f3869c17fc415d810cf96159c7dd8d340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,236,77,15,56,105,193,127,196,21,216,16,207,150,21,156,125,216,211,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
