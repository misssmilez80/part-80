Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.\n\n\nAudio : (1) English - Dolby Digital 5.1 - 448 Kbps\n\n        (2) Director Commentary - English\n\nSubs :     English, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, , Dutch, Portuguese-Br, Arabic, Croatian,  Czech,  Greek, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Chinese x2, Romanian\n\n\nNTSC\n2.35:1\n108 min\n\n\nCustom Menu,  with custom added subs found on the web.\n\nSource : Pandorum DVDR-BOW (R1 retail)\n\nVSO was used to add custom sub, this is not converted from XviD copy.\n\n\nr.i.p. mininova\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:154c694e6204723b101190ef37c002b139e2c373","amp;dn":"Pandorum+2009+DVDR+%7B16+subs%7D-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"154c694e6204723b101190ef37c002b139e2c373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,76,105,78,98,4,114,59,16,17,144,239,55,192,2,177,57,226,195,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
