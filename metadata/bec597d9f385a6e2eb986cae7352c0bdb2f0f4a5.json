As punishment, he gets promoted to principal -- of the worst high school in the city. This is the kind of drug-infested campus where students carry weapons and teachers spend most of their time trying to keep their charges from killing each other. Before Latimer can bring education back into the classrooms of Brandel High, he must put down the school's number one menace, gang leader Victor Duncan. In the process, the ne'er-do-well pedagogue finds his own life taking a surprising turn.\n\nStarring: James Belushi, Louis Gossett, Rae Dawn Chong, Michael Wright, Joe Flood, Reggie Johnson, Kelly Jo Minter, Esai Morales\n\nDirector: Christopher Cain\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI got this copy from usenet, and it doesn't have a .nfo file, so I don't know if it's either compressed or not.\n\nAudio: EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol, Italiano, Deutsch, FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais and English\nSubtitles: English, FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais, Deutsch, Italiano, EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol, Nederlands, Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Dansk, Suomi, Greek, iw, Hindi and Magyar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec597d9f385a6e2eb986cae7352c0bdb2f0f4a5","amp;dn":"The+Principal+1987+-+PAL+DVD5+-+Multilanguage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec597d9f385a6e2eb986cae7352c0bdb2f0f4a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,197,151,217,243,133,166,226,235,152,108,174,115,82,192,189,178,240,244,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
