Fast forward to \n           2010, and the President then tells the entire    \n           planet that the world is ending. This begins a   \n           state of panic and widespread decay of humanity  \n           as the Earth itself begins to fall apart forever.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy nehalkhalid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:048bfc14c915d37df4b811a7f34892bf26f6f538","amp;dn":"2012+CAM+2009+Best+Print+XviD-TPB+Release+nEhal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"048bfc14c915d37df4b811a7f34892bf26f6f538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,139,252,20,201,21,211,125,244,184,17,167,243,72,146,191,38,246,245,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
