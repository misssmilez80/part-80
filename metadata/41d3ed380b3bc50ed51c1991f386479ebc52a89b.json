Like his previous six solo albums, it has nothing more on its mind than a good time, a studio party where everybody is invited. \nWoods alcohol problems have been well documented but when he is well, he is an artist of the highest caliber. He wrote ten of the twelve tracks, which speaks well for his health. The lyrics are introspective and thoughtful as many of them focus on the problems that have plagued him. He does not give in to his weaknesses but faces them bluntly through this music. There is sorrow, bitterness, criticism, and a little triumph mixed in for good measure. His raspy voice remains an effective instrument to interpret his songs.\n\n\nSpecial guest guitarists on this album -\nSlash - 5 songs\nBilly Gibbons - 2 songs\nBobby Womack - 2 songs\nWaddy Watchel - 2 songs\n\nOther guests -\nIan McLagan (Stones, Faces)\nDaryl Jones (Stones bassist)\nSteve Ferrone (Tom Petty drummer)\nBlondie Chaplin (Beach Boys, Stones, &amp; great solo stuff!!)\nFlea (Red Hot Chili Peppers)\n\n\n 1.
