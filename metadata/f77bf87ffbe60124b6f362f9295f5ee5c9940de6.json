I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  \n\nThis contains the m4b files\nfor mp3: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191496\n\nThis is not the book series that the TV series Blood Ties is based off of. That series is called Victoria Nelson/Victory Nelson and it is by Tanya Huff.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77bf87ffbe60124b6f362f9295f5ee5c9940de6","amp;dn":"Blood+Ties+Audiobooks+1-4+Chaptered+m4b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77bf87ffbe60124b6f362f9295f5ee5c9940de6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,123,248,127,251,230,1,36,182,243,98,249,41,95,94,229,201,148,13,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
