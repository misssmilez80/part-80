It is optimised for netbook systems (usually a 9 or 10 inch display) with a minimum vertical screen resolution of 576 pixels. It is built on the same KDE 4.3 base as Kubuntu, but uses a technical preview version of KDE's forthcoming Plasma Netbook to provide the basic 'desktop' environment. Kubuntu has worked with the Plasma Netbook developers to provide a basic first look at the initial vision from KDE for supporting netbooks.\n\nKubuntu Netbook Edition 9.10 will be useful for many, but is not for everyone. It provides an early look at the plasma shell that will enable people to interact with standard KDE applications in a way optimised for netbook systems. It is useful, functional, and reliable. It does have a few rough edges, but should be usable by many people without problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5137c011eae0798f90b9d646827e44f9b0b6e97","amp;dn":"Kubuntu+9.10+Netbook+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5137c011eae0798f90b9d646827e44f9b0b6e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,19,124,1,30,174,7,152,249,11,157,100,104,39,228,79,155,11,110,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
