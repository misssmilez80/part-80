In a new layer named Volcano, fill with a brownish color. With black in the foreground color and brown in the background, choose FIlter &gt; Render Fibers. This will give you a nice earthy texture. Distort the shape by pulling in the top corners to create a volcano shape. Apply the filter, Watercolor, and fade the opacity of the filter to about 36% so that the original grooves of the volcano still show through. Create a new layer mask on the Volcano layer, and use black to create a mask around the edges of the volcano. This gives the appearance of rough edges, much like a real mountain.\n\n*** Make fire and lava\nFalling lava: Choose a red color for the foreground color. With various brush sizes, hand draw falling lava that comes from the top of the volcano shape. Apply an outer glow with a red tone, and a bevel &amp; emboss, which will make the lava look hot and shiny. The highlight should be yellow and the shadow should be orange when applying settings to bevel &amp; emboss.\n\n*** Spewing lava from the top of the volcano\nUse a large spatter brush with high spacing in a new layer below the volcano. Use red for the foreground and yellow for the background color, then apply these colors in the brush settings. Warp the layer to create perspective of spewing lava. After you have your desired shape, add additional spatters.\n\n*** Add smoke\nIn a new layer above all others, apply the Filter &gt; Render Clouds using black and white. Use Warp to create a shape stemming from the opening of the volcano. Use an eraser to soften the edges.\n\n*** Create red highlights in the smoke\nCopy the smoke into an alpha channel, then duplicate the alpha channel to create a mask that filters can be applied to. Move the second channel up and over a little to create a shift. Choose Image &gt; Calculations, and subtract one mask from the other, and the result will be a new tone that you can lighten with Levels. Load the new channel, and in a new top layer, fill the area with red\n\n*** Adjust lighting to create shadows\nCreate a black and white radial gradient in a layer above the volcano. Clip the gradient to the layer, and additional texture and lighting accents the volcano.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
