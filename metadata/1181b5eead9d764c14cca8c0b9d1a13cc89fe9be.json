It is unfortunate but you just get the feel from this film that the team were not at there best when they made it, some of the jokes fall a bit flat and some of the performances are ropey at best. There are some good jokes scattered throughout the piece but I just couldn't get off the feeling that this was an opportunity wasted. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1181b5eead9d764c14cca8c0b9d1a13cc89fe9be","amp;dn":"Blackadder+Back+%26+Forth+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1181b5eead9d764c14cca8c0b9d1a13cc89fe9be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,129,181,238,173,157,118,76,20,204,168,192,185,209,161,60,200,159,233,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
