The band consisted of singer George Belanger, guitarist Glen Willows, Gary Golden on keyboards, drummer David Budzak and Ralph James on bass. Within a year they were doing regular gigs across mid and eastern Canada and were signed to Epic Records in 1979.\n\nTheir debut album, VICTIM OF A SONG was produced by Jack Douglas, who'd previously worked with the likes of Cheap Trick, Patty Smith, Aerosmith and John Lennon. Released that fall, it immediately made an impression with both the critics and the fans alike. \n\nFollowing a year long tour which saw them open for such heavyweights as April Wine &amp; BTO, they returned to the studios for LOVE CRIMES, released in the summer of 1980. Again, the airwaves were filled with the tight harmonies and catchy rhythms of the singles &quot;Innocence&quot; and &quot;Thinking Of You&quot;.\n\nInnocence \nLove on the Rocks \nThinking of You \nIt's All Over Now \nHeaven (Dial 999)\nSaying Goodbye to the Boys \nWait for the Night \nCrime of Passion \nCan't Hold Back \nMidnight Magic\n\nMy rip from vinyl.\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8821dadc98d5f5f213f3d7dca339022c51a6069","amp;dn":"Harlequin+-+Love+Crimes+%281980%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8821dadc98d5f5f213f3d7dca339022c51a6069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,130,29,173,201,141,95,95,33,63,61,125,202,51,144,34,197,26,96,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
