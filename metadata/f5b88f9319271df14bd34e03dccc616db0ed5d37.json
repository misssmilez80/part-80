Eric believes to overhear Laurie telling Hyde an embarrassing secret about him which nobody will specify, so he carelessly 'admits as insignificant' to the basement mates that he was known in summer-camp as Doctor Pipi -a confidence she actually kept- and starts a ratting duel with Laurie, who also takes a more practical revenge... Red asks Kitty out to the French restaurant, but tells her to wear his late mother's necklace, which she pawned when the family was out of groceries budget... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 23: Holy Crap\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½1 May 2000\n\nKitty can't go to church because of an extra hospital shift, but orders her kids to go, alone. Eric would, but Laurie's bad example is irresistible; alas, Bob reports their absence. Kitty now says they're old enough to make the right choice on their own, and expects them to go next Sunday, but neither seriously considers that. As if sitting alone in the pew weren't bad enough for Kitty, Bob nags about horny Eric needing prayer most and as ever spaced-out Leo asks to sit next to her. Back home Kitty blames Red's bad example and plays her last trump card: youth minister Dave, who tries to appeal to the kids in their own terms... Hyde points out to Kelso losing Jackie means he can again do everything he likes and she forbade, i.e. anything; Michael focuses first on growing a beard, which foreigner Fez is naturally better at, but Jackie still finds Kelso's sexiest... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 24: Red Fired Up\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½8 May 2000\n\nEric does well working at Price Mart, even gets sincere praise from Red, who actually sets him as example for a former plant colleague, eternal malingerer Earl, who becomes the primary butt of their jokes, but ends up going too far... Kelso realizes Jackie is too short to be worth missing, there are many girls still to see naked, but makes a bad start: Laurie, who gets a lecture from Kitty, Michael simultaneously a simplified version from Hyde, against their mismatched affair. The boys' basement becomes a bit of a battleground...\n\n\n \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 25: Cat Fight Club\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½15 May 2000\n\nJackie tries to win a 'burn' duel with Laurie, but Hyde convinces her it's better to 'be Zen.' Despite everybody's warnings, Michael accepts Laurie's invitation for dinner, which Kitty actually forbade her to extend. Although lover-boy sweetly brought gifts, inhospitable host Red scares Kelso out of the door in seconds; later the Korean vet locks the intimidated boy in the garage for operation &quot;Scare the pants off daughter's new lover.&quot; When Laurie returns to the basement, Jackie's Zen for beginners soon gives way to a cat-fight. As Hyde puts it, &quot;Where the Zen ends, the ass-kicking begins.&quot; \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 26: Moon Over Point Place\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½22 May 2000\n\nThe Vikings yearbook contains a surprising picture: Donna smiling with her 'lower cheeks'. Just when Eric was resigning to it going generally unnoticed, Timmy happily makes it as public in the diner as he drops trou at parties. Red was happy Bob canceled the couples' cards night, frustrated by Eric's carnal communion with Donna, but Kitty insists to bring them together to talk it trough; just then Eric decides to follow the mooner's example. Hyde made clear not to reciprocate Jackie's sudden crush for him, but still takes the blame for the weed she bought to impress him, which lands him in jail... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch:\n\nSeizoen 2 dvd 4\n\nThat '70s Show is de populaire retro show die gaat over het leven van een groep tieners in de Amerikaanse plaats Point Place.
