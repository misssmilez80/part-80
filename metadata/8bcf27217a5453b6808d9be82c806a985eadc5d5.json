It should provide most of the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software. \n\nSandra is a (girl) name of Greek origin that means &quot;defender&quot;, &quot;helper of mankind&quot;. We think that's quite fitting. \n\nIt works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to go beyond them and show you more of what's really going on. Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. You can get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, PCI, PCI-X, PCIe (PCI Express), database, USB, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc.\n\nList of current modules\nSystem Summary \nMainboard/Chipset/System Monitors Info \nCPU/BIOS Info \nAPM &amp; ACPI (Advanced Power Management) Info \nPCI(e), AGP, CardBus, PCMCIA bus and devices Info \nVideo Information (monitor, card, video bios, caps, etc.) \nOpenGL Information \nDirectX (DirectDraw, Direct3D, DirectSound (3D), DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectInput) Info \nKeyboard Info \nMouse Info\n\nSound Card (wave, midi, aux, mix) Info \nMCI Devices (mpeg, avi, seq, vcr, video-disc, wave) Info \nJoystick Info \nPrinters Info \nWindows Memory Info \nWindows Info \nFont (Raster, Vector, TrueType, OpenType) Information \nModem/ISDN TA Information \nNetwork Information \nIP Network Information\n \nWinSock &amp; Internet Security Information \nDrives Information (Removable Hard Disks, CD-ROM/DVD, RamDrives, etc.) \nPorts (Serial/Parallel) Info \nRemote Access Service Connections (Dial-Up, Internet)* \nOLE objects/servers Info* \nProcesses (Tasks) &amp; Threads Info \nModules (DLL, DRV) Info \nServices &amp; Device Drivers (SYS) Info* \nSCSI, SAS Information* \nATA, ATAPI, SATA, RAID Information\n\nData Sources Information* \nCMOS/RTC Information* \nSmart Card &amp; SIM Card Information* \nArithmetic Benchmark (including SSE2, SSSE3) \nMulti-Media Benchmark (including MMX, Wireless MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3) \nMulti-Core Efficiency Benchmark \nPower Management Efficiency Benchmark \nFile System (Removable, Hard Disks, Network, RamDrives) Benchmark \nRemovable Storage/Flash Benchmark \nCD-ROM/DVD Benchmark\n\nMemory Bandwidth Benchmark \nCache &amp; Memory Bandwidth Benchmark \nNetwork/LAN Bandwidth Benchmark \nInternet/ISP Connection Benchmark \nInternet/ISP Peerage Benchmark \nHardware Interrupts Usage* \nDMA Channel Usage* \nI/O Ports Usage* \nMemory Range Usage* \nPlug &amp; Play Enumerator\n\nHardware registry settings \nEnvironment settings \nRegistered File Types \nKey Applications* (web-browser, e-mail, news, anti-virus, firewall, etc.) \nInstalled Applications* \nInstalled Programs* \nStart Menu Applications* \nOn-disk Programs &amp; Libraries* \nInstalled Web Packages* (ActiveX, Java classes) \nSystem Event Logs\n\nBurn-in Wizard* (test computer stability) \nConnect Wizard (connect to remote computers, PDAs, Smart Phones and other devices) \nCombined Performance Index Wizard (overall computer performance score) \nCreate a Report Wizard (save, print, fax or e-mail in CIM (SMS/DMI), HTML, XML, RPT or TEXT format) \nPerformance Tune-Up Wizard (tune-up computer) \nEnvironment Monitor Wizard (temperatures, voltages, fans, CPU power, cooling solution thermal resistance, etc.) \nWebUpdate Wizard for automatic version updating\n\n\nInstallation\nUnpack SiSoft Sandra Pro 2009 SP4.rar\nRun fo-9sp4.exe\nInsert Serial when asked from the fosi.nfo file\n\n\n\n                                          !!!!!ENJOY!!!!!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bcf27217a5453b6808d9be82c806a985eadc5d5","amp;dn":"SiSoft+Sandra+Pro+2009+SP4++%5Bpmsyb%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bcf27217a5453b6808d9be82c806a985eadc5d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,207,39,33,122,84,83,182,128,141,155,232,44,128,106,152,94,173,197,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
