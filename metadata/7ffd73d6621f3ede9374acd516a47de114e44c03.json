There, gaining great powers under Earth's yellow sun, he will become a champion of truth and justice. Raised by the Kents, an elderly farm couple, Clark Kent learns that his abilities must be used for good. The adult Clark travels to Metropolis, where he becomes a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet...and a caped wonder whose amazing feats stun the city: Superman! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor, the world's greatest criminal mind, is plotting the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Can't even the Man of Steel stop this nefarious scheme?\n\n\t\t\n\n\nCodec..........: H.264\nResolution.....: 1920x1080\nBitrate........: 3.3 Mbps\nFramerate......: 24fps\nAudio..........: AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1CH Surround (448Kbs)\nSubtitles......: None\nExtension......: M2TS\n\n\nPlease if you like the movie PLEASE SEED it so others can enjoy it to.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ffd73d6621f3ede9374acd516a47de114e44c03","amp;dn":"Superman.1978.1080p.AC3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.ps3.Bricktop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ffd73d6621f3ede9374acd516a47de114e44c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,253,115,214,98,31,62,222,147,116,172,213,22,164,125,225,20,228,76,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
