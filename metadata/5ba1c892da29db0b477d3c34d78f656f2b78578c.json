Originally a trio comprising vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross and drummer Myles Heskett, the band released their debut self-titled album in October 2005, which reached number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. The album was also a critical success, winning the 2005 J Award and 2006 ARIA Awards for Best Breakthrough Album and Best Rock Album. &quot;Woman&quot;, a single from the album, won the band their first Grammy Award, for Best Hard Rock Performance, in 2007.\n\nIn August 2008, co-founding members Ross and Heskett left the band due to &quot;irreconcilable personal and musical differences,&quot; after which Stockdale vowed to continue using the Wolfmother moniker with new members in the future. After a brief hiatus, Stockdale returned with a new four-piece band in January 2009 featuring bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins. The new lineup's first album (entitled Cosmic Egg) was released on 23 October 2009.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba1c892da29db0b477d3c34d78f656f2b78578c","amp;dn":"Wolfmother+-+Woman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba1c892da29db0b477d3c34d78f656f2b78578c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,161,200,146,218,41,219,11,71,125,60,52,215,143,101,111,43,120,87,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
