I renounced my American citizenship in 2008 and I have been a voluntary exile since 2004, presently living in Bratislava, Slovakia. As of this recording in June 2009, I maintain a website at www.nostate.com, which you are invited to visit.\n\nThe words you will hear belong to all of humanity, but they were written by Kevin Carson, a leading contemporary thinker in mutualism and individualist anarchism, and Research Associate for the Center for a Stateless Society, c4ss.org. The essay, The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand: Corporate Capitalism as a State-Guaranteed System of Privilege, was published in 2001, and is available online at CarsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mutualist Blog, from flag.blackened.net, and from Red Lion Press in print form.\n\nFor the recording, I have broken the essay into ten parts:\n\n    * Introduction\n    * The Subsidy of History\n    * Ideological Hegemony\n    * The Money Monopoly\n    * Patents\n    * Infrastructure\n    * Military Keynesianism\n    * Other Subsidies\n    * Political Repression\n    * Conclusion\n\nI have attempted to read the text of Iron Fist as I have it in hand. Any deviations from the written text are my own.\n\nIt is worth noting for more mainstream libertarians and others not familiar with CarsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work that one need not adopt CarsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mutualism or his predictions regarding profit, rent and interest in a truly free market in order to find the analysis and historiography contained here of great value.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a823f57376a077be49d8f9475256319005711e85","amp;dn":"The+Iron+Fist+Behind+the+Invisible+Hand+by+Kevin+A.+Carson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a823f57376a077be49d8f9475256319005711e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,35,245,115,118,160,119,190,73,216,249,71,82,86,49,144,5,113,30,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
