This makes it possible for us to parse the information. However, in the case of psychological pain, the information to be parsed is not always quantifiable. Thus, we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know how to process this data. There are many cases in the human experience where this psychological pain is experienced. In the larger scope, say in the death of a loved one, the healing may take years. Or in some cases, the healing never occurs. In the case of facing oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own death, this pain is so great that we create vices, fetishes, addictions, or many other deviations and distractions to deal with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproblemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at hand. We live in constant fear and denial of the impending termination. The brain is a biological organ with a specific function like many of the other body parts. For example, our legs are used to transport us from one place to another. If we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use them, the muscles shrink and become less useful. The brain too has a primary function. Its main purpose is to create meaning by processing data. When events are too large for the brain to process, the brain will create scenarios to fabricate a meaning. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sort of like job-security for the brain. Like an unproductive employee, a damaged brain will create faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ades of productivity to protect the ego. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understandingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says the poet Khalil Gibran. In Justify, Abby Lombard thinks that avenging the death of her father is going to bring resolve to this psychological pain. For Abby however, it is simply another nihilistic puzzle created by her ego.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Insung Hwang\n\nFilm posted on Amazon Studios as a TEST FILM for free distribtuion!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea744d849bb1e9bf77e6769700e45eec3008eb71","amp;dn":"Justify+the+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea744d849bb1e9bf77e6769700e45eec3008eb71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,116,77,132,155,177,233,191,119,230,118,151,0,228,94,236,48,8,235,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
