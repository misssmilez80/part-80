The film is semi-officially based on their comedy television series Bottom (in some territories, the DVD cover refers to it as The Bottom Movie). The key difference in the characters is in their names: Mayall's character, known as &quot;Richard Richard&quot; in the TV show, is here referred to as &quot;Richard Twat&quot; (although he regularly and angrily insists on the pronunciation &quot;Thwaite&quot;). Edmondson's character changes from &quot;Edward Elizabeth Hitler&quot; in the TV/live show to &quot;Edward Elizabeth Ndingombaba&quot;. The film was made at Ealing studios and on location on the Isle of Wight.\n\n.: SPECIFICS :.\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 643 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWriting application              : MEncoder 1.0pre7-3.3.4\nWriting library                  : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate                         : 914 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 272 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.210\nStream size                      : 561 MiB (87%)\nWriting library                  : FFmpeg0.4.9-pre1b4752\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 78.6 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 500 ms (12.50 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba728ba4da4be5feb288ef2c6ceca83b393c9a76","amp;dn":"Guest+House+Paradiso+1999+-+DivX+-+Ita+Mp3+-+TNTVillage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba728ba4da4be5feb288ef2c6ceca83b393c9a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,114,139,164,218,75,229,254,178,136,239,44,108,236,168,59,57,60,154,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
