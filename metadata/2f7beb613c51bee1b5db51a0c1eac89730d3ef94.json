Unfortunately I couldn't upload using the same file name. I hope no one has to start from scratch again. I'm truly sorry for my mistake.\n\n\nA young Scottish girl's cat, Thomasina, apparently dies at the hands of her widowed veterinarian father. The strained relationship between the girl and her father is eventually repaired with the return of Thomasina and the aid of a beautiful and mysterious &quot;witch&quot; who seems to have powers to revive and heal animals.\n\n\nThis is a complete DVD rip which includes all the extras. Just download and burn.\n\nComments Welcome.
