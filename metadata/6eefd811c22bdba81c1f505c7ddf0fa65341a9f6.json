For example, it provides a means to list or search for named resources that are held by a process or all processes. This can be used to track down what is holding a file open and preventing its use by another program. Or as another example, it can show the command lines used to start a program, allowing otherwise identical processes to be distinguished. Or like Task Manager, it can show a process that is maxing out the CPU, but unlike Task Manager it can show which thread (with the callstack) is using the CPU ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ information that is not even available under a debugger.\n\nProcess Explorer is one of a set of administration and monitoring utilities available from the Microsoft Sysinternals website.\n\nUntil 2008 Process Explorer worked on Windows 9x/Me, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista including 64-bit versions. The current (Aug 200 Process Explorer Homepage states that it works on Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 and upwards.\n\nRecent versions downloaded with the Sysinternals Suite fully support 64 bit versions of Vista and Windows 7 x64 with a second binary, procexp64.exe. This is transparent and the user need not run it or even know about it; procexp.exe calls it as needed.\n\nInstructions: Once downloaded, unzip and double click (exe) application.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eefd811c22bdba81c1f505c7ddf0fa65341a9f6","amp;dn":"ProcessExplorer+%28zip%29+%5BNugmonster%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eefd811c22bdba81c1f505c7ddf0fa65341a9f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,239,216,17,194,43,219,168,28,31,80,92,125,223,15,166,83,65,169,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
