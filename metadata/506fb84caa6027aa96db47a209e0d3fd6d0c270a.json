The meaning was to put &quot;Vlaamse Slagers&quot; and other popular hitmusic in a punky/hardcore jacket.\n\nAfter doing one cover, things started to itch to make an own song. Since then, covers were left behind and they started playing a mix of punk with metal/hardcoreriffs. Two shows were done with this lineup.\n\nNot long after this, the band decided they need a second guitar player to enforce the songs. Bjorn (ex-Sagaris, ex-Requiem, ex-Immanent Distance) was found to do this job. He learned the songs in no time and new material was written. A first demo was recorded at the &quot;Bonnets studio&quot;.\n\nThe style evolved and the direction became heavier. An EP - &quot;Whores Of The Grapevine&quot; was recorded. Unfortunately, at the end of 2008, the band broke ways with Tomme and soon thereafter, also Nekke left the band.\n\nLuckily, shortly thereafter, a new drummer was found in Dries (Immanent Distance, Loss Of Sanity). For the vocals we found our hope in Thomas(Varangian, Loss Of Sanity) and Laban(ex-Hit By A Truck).\n\nWith this current line-up, we keep evolving in our style and music.\n\nTracklist\n----------\n1) Cocks And Tears\n2) Remember The Filth\n3) Love Sucks Let's party\n4) What's In It For Me\n5) Whores Of The Grapevine\n6) Fakers Fade Out Bash\n\n\nenjoy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.twonightsinparis.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.twonightsinparis.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506fb84caa6027aa96db47a209e0d3fd6d0c270a","amp;dn":"Two+Nights+In+Paris+-+Whores+Of+The+Grapevine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506fb84caa6027aa96db47a209e0d3fd6d0c270a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,111,184,76,170,96,39,170,150,219,71,162,9,224,211,253,109,12,39,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
