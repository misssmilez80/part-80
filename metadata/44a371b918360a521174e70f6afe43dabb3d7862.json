Betaverse, the universe Charlie is initially sent to, corresponds to &quot;our&quot; reality. But there's a third universe, the Gammaverse, an apparent Utopia that has an abundance of natural resources that Vex-Cor (one of the Alphaverse mega-corps) would like to exploit.\n\nCharlie Jade was filmed in Cape Town, South Africa and produced by CHUM Television and the South African Industrial Development Corporation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44a371b918360a521174e70f6afe43dabb3d7862","amp;dn":"Charlie+Jade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44a371b918360a521174e70f6afe43dabb3d7862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,163,113,185,24,54,10,82,17,116,231,15,106,254,67,218,187,61,120,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
