Not only did it blow people away with its award winning DJ sets, amazing pyro and laser effects, as well as daredevil acrobatics and sensual water nymphs, but it reaped a couple of awards in the process, with Sensation, The Ocean of White!\n\n\nWith this mind and after receiving countless emails from an ever enthusiastic public, it gives us great pleasure to announce that Sensation will return with its new show, the Wicked Wonderland, based on the surreal story of Alice's adventure in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.\n\nEnter this world of mystery and imagination and be taken on a sensual journey beyond your wildest dreams on the 31st of October, 2009 at the PARKEN stadium, Copenhagen.\n\n\nLINE-UP: [96 kbps]\n19:30pm - 20:55pm Erick E\n20:55pm - 22:15pm Morten Breum\n22:15pm - 22:40pm The Mix\n22:40pm - 23:40pm Mr. White\n23:40pm - 01:35am Axwell &amp; Sebastian Ingrosso\n01:35am - 03:00am Tocadisco\n\n\n19:30pm - 20:55pm Erick E\nID\n\n\n\n20:55pm - 22:15pm Morten Breum\n01.
