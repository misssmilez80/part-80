The scenario repeats itself with Ace of Base, whose European hits collection, Singles of the 90s, includes six songs not featured on the American Greatest Hits. The American collection, to its credit, includes bonus remixes of &quot;Lucky Love&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Life,&quot; but, honestly, would one prefer to have two bonus remixes of songs already included on the album or six altogether different songs? Singles of the 90s includes two new recordings not on the American album, those being the dance track &quot;Love in December&quot; and &quot;Hallo Hallo&quot; (the other new recording, featured on both albums, is &quot;C'est la Vie&quot;). In addition, this set includes &quot;Living in Danger,&quot; which was a Top 20 hit in the U.S.; &quot;Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry,&quot; which also charted in America; and two stellar tracks from their debut album, The Sign: &quot;Happy Nation&quot; (the title track of the European version of The Sign) and &quot;Wheel of Fortune.&quot; So, for fans looking for the best Ace of Base hits collection on the market who don't mind shelling out a few extra bucks, go with Singles of the 90s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045e1c82877e492f6b514ba6b169dcfe913b89ff","amp;dn":"Ace+Of+Base+-+Singles+Of+The+90s+%28FLAC-EAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045e1c82877e492f6b514ba6b169dcfe913b89ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,94,28,130,135,126,73,47,107,81,75,166,177,105,220,254,145,59,137,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
