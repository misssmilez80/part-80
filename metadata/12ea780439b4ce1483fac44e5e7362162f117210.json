Ilie Stepan showed us his current concerns with the previous record, The Meaning of Life (1996). The confirmation has arrived after five years of hard work: Stepan Project (consisting of Ilie Stepan, Horia CriÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ovan, Mircea Stratan) offers us a double CD, released by Show Factory, a multimedia disc completed by a remarkably crafted booklet, containing a presentation of the work, lyrics and pictures.\n\nThe album has been signaled to the Universe at the 0th hour of the year 2001 by the video &quot;Lumina&quot;, launched on the Internet. Also, the work of its creators, a 60 minutes documentary, was shown on TVR channel.\n\nGrand opus, evocation of our time and space, mixture of sounds (old instruments, nature &quot;noises&quot;) and genres, an impressive fusion to which notable contemporary music personalities have contributed, 30 in number, but also the Anastasis Choir, Saint Joseph Psaltic Choir from PartoÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸, Wandering Drummers from Povergina and wailers from SÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢nÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â£a.\n\nSo, jazz, folk, chamber music, avant-garde, rock, songs having folk, academic or religious lyrics, everything recorder, mixed and mastered at Radio Vest and the Show Factory. Ilie Stepan said that &quot;the symphonic music of the 19th century became the rock music of the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the folklore is the sum of a nation's feelings&quot;, statements that suggest the basis of this work.\n\nA titanic effort, an impressive result, maybe the peak recording of the year 2001.\n\n\nActualitatea MuzicalÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™ - Rock Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12ea780439b4ce1483fac44e5e7362162f117210","amp;dn":"Stepan+Project+-+2001+-+Undeva+in+Europa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12ea780439b4ce1483fac44e5e7362162f117210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,234,120,4,57,180,206,20,131,250,196,78,94,115,98,22,47,17,114,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
