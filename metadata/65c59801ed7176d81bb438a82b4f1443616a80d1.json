The track itself took on a new look in '57, with a new control tower the focal point of the new tower Terrace grandstand and pit area.  Here's the story of winning car owner George Salih and the yellow #9 Belond Special, with highlights of the changes in race car design at the speedway from the years 1951 to 1957.  Throughout qualifications and the race itself, you'll see the racing personalities and great drivers of 54 years ago in nice close-ups and in action on the track.  The race is a duel between Rathmann, Hanks, Bryan and Russo.\n\nRun time is 34 minutes.\n\nEnjoy.  comments welcome\n\nplease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c59801ed7176d81bb438a82b4f1443616a80d1","amp;dn":"1957+Indy+500+-+The+500+Mile+Adventure+-+DVD+copy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c59801ed7176d81bb438a82b4f1443616a80d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,197,152,1,237,113,118,216,27,180,56,168,43,79,20,67,97,106,128,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
