Unlike the original Diablo's expansion pack, Diablo: Hellfire, it is a first-party expansion developed by Blizzard North.\n\nMore than a standard expansion, Lord of Destruction not only added content in the form of two new character classes, new weapons and an addition of a fifth act, but also dramatically revamped the gameplay of the existing Diablo II for solo and especially multiplayer.\n\nFeatures\nLord of Destruction adds a number of new features to the core gameplay of Diablo II. These include:\n*Two new character classes: the Assassin and the Druid.\n*A fifth act taking place in and around Mount Arreat in the northern  \nBarbarian Highlands, with an additional act boss, Baal.\n*Many new weapons and new pieces of armor:\n*Runes can be placed into sockets and provide different bonuses from\ngems.\n*Using Horadric Cube, needed quest item for Act 2 and runes as recipes,  \none can empower the items. The process is called &quot;cubing.&quot;\n*&quot;Crafted items&quot; are very similar to rare items but they cannot be found\nin chests or dropped by monsters. They can be created with the Horadric *Cube and the right ingredients. They have 3-4 fixed properties that\nwill enhance the items.\n\n*&quot;Runewords&quot; are very powerful bonuses that are granted to an item when\nspecific runes are socketed in a specific order.\n*&quot;Jewels&quot; gain the same random bonuses that items can. These can be\nplaced into sockets. They have the same effect no matter what the base\nitem is. Unique jewels are &quot;Rainbow Facets&quot; which have different\nbonuses to a certain element.\n*Ethereal items that are normally more powerful than their standard\ncounterparts, but they have lowered durability and cannot be repaired.\n*Charms that can be kept in the inventory and provide passive bonuses.\n*Class-specific items that can only be used by a certain character, e.g.\nClaws for an Assassin.\n*Additional unique and set items, including class-specific sets.\nAn expanded stash for storing itemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½two times the size of the original\nstash.\n*An alternate weapon/shield/spell setup that can be switched to via a\nhotkey in gameplay.\n*Hirelings can now follow the player through all the Acts. They can also\nbe equipped with armor and a weapon, can gain their own experience\n(originally they leveled up with the player), can be healed by potions,\nand can be resurrected when killed.\n*The game can now be played at 800x600 resolution, up from 640x480.\n\nAct V Boss Levels\nPlacing the runes &quot;Jah&quot;, &quot;Ith&quot; and &quot;Ber&quot; (in that order) into an armour item with exactly three sockets produces the powerful Rune word &quot;Enigma&quot;.\n\nThere are several boss monsters in Act V.\n\nThe player fights Shenk the Overseer in the Bloody Foothills, just outside Harrogath, who is directly in charge of the siege on Harrogath. The player must also rescue Anya in order to gain a valuable scroll of increased resistances. After Anya, the player also has to find and kill Nihlathak, who is sheltered between his minions in the Halls of Vaught. Before gaining access to the Worldstone Keep, the player must defeat The Ancients, which are the three Barbarians guarding the Worldstone who allow only the worthy to pass.\n\nFinally, the player fights Baal in The Worldstone Chamber, after defeating his pack of minions at the Throne of Destruction. Tyrael appears after Baal is dead, congratulating the player and opening a portal to Destruction's End, the conclusion of the game.\n\nNew classes\n\nAssassin\nThe Assassin relies on a mixture of martial arts skills and the ability to lay passive traps. She can also open locked chests without the use of a key.\n\nHer Shadow Disciplines tree contains a mixture of passive bonuses (such as Claw Mastery or Weapon Block) and buffs (such as Burst of Speed or Venom), along with a few spells such as Mind Blast which stun and confuse the enemy rather than causing direct damage. She also can summon a Shadow Warrior or Shadow Master, which are useful summons that are also capable of dealing significant damage themselves.\n\nThe Traps tree provides a few direct attacks, and more importantly, a number of summonable traps. The traps are stationary devices that will attack any hostile target in range a certain number of times before breaking. Traps are either based on fire or lightning, though the Death Sentry trap can explode nearby corpses in addition to shooting bolts of lightning. The blade trap skills are essentially ranged projectiles that cause physical damage.\n\nThe Martial Arts tree consists of charge-up skills and finishing moves. Attacking with a charge-up skill increases the number of charges, up to three, then the finishing move releases the charges in a single powerful blow (note that a normal attack also counts as a finishing move). The charge-up skills include attacks like Blades of Ice and Fists of Fire, which add elemental damage to the finishing blow, and also skills like Cobra Strike, which adds life and mana stealing to the finishing attack. The finishing blows are, for the most part, kicks, such as Dragon Talon, which releases a number of kicks in quick succession, and Dragon Flight, which teleports on to a target and kicks them, releasing any charges.\n\nDruid\nThe Druid specialises in nature-based magic and shapeshifting, with direct damage spells and a variety of minions. The Druid is voiced by Michael Bell.\n\nThe Elemental tree consists of the magic of earth and sky. The 'storm' spells have effects like Cyclone Armor, which protects the Druid from the elements, and Tornado, a vortex of swirling winds that moves somewhat randomly and can deal massive damage. The 'fire' spells are more earthly than the Sorceress's, with spells like Fissure and Volcano. The ultimate Elemental spells are Hurricane and Armageddon; both create a storm that follows the Druid, damaging all that come too close.\n\nThe Summoning tree governs the calling of natural allies to the Druid. While the wolves and grizzly the Druid can summon are traditional melee summons, the other summoning spells are a bit different. Ravens do marginal damage, but can blind enemies and cannot be targeted. Ravens disappear after they have attacked a certain number of times. The Druid can summon sages that provide Paladin-like Auras, such as increasing damage, life, or returning damage back to the attacker (like the Necromancer's Iron Maiden). The Druid also can summon one of three vines. These can poison enemies from below, or consume corpses to replenish the Druid's life or mana.\n\nThe Shape-Shifting tree gives the Druid the ability to become an animal himself, with gigantic bonuses to life. The Druid may either become a nimble Werewolf or a large Werebear. Each form has its own special attacks, such as the Werewolf's Feral Rage, which causes the Druid to get faster and faster as he continues to attack enemies, and the Werebear's Maul, which makes the Druid swing harder and harder during attacks. The Werebear is also able to obtain substantially more life and armor than the Werewolf is. It is worth noting that all of the Druid's equipment functions as normal when shifted, if at different speeds, but the druid is virtually unable to cast spells, except for Armageddon and summoning ones.\n\nHow to install\n**************\n1.
