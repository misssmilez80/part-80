On the other hand, that task would be difficult enough for a full-fledged anthology of Zappa, let alone a budget sampler, so take it for what it is -- a cheaply priced introduction for the cash-strapped. Still, if you choose to acclimate yourself to Zappa this way, the first Cheap Thrills remains the better of the two, containing as it does a larger percentage of career high points. \n\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
