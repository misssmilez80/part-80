However, many doctors, advocacy groups, policy makers and consumers are concerned that electronic health systems might help individuals and communities with greater resources while leaving behind those with limited access to technology. In order to address this problem, the Institute of Medicine's Roundtable on Health Literacy held a workshop to explore the current status of communication technology, the challenges for its use in populations with low health literacy, and the strategies for increasing the benefit of these technologies for populations with low health literacy. The summary of the workshop, &quot;Health Literacy, eHealth, and Communication: Putting the Consumer First,&quot; includes participants' comments on these issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b7875d61cf556802580c3b17e228fd48235a537","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Health+Literacy%2C+eHealth%2C+and+Communication+Putting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b7875d61cf556802580c3b17e228fd48235a537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,120,117,214,28,245,86,128,37,128,195,177,126,34,143,212,130,53,165,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
