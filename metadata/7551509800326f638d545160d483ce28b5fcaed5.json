It should provide most\nof the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your\nhardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software.\n\nSandra is a (girl) name of Greek origin that means &quot;defender&quot;, &quot;helper of\nmankind&quot;. We think that's quite fitting.\n\nIt works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to\ngo beyond them and show you more of what's really going on. Giving the\nuser the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level.
