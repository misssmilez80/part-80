The mid-tempo pop rock song was written by David Hodges, Mitch Allan, and American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi. McPhee describes the song as being about &quot;a girl that went out to look for a different love and thought that she could find something better and realized at the end 'Wow, I really had it all.'&quot; She also says the song is very much upbeat and with a &quot;positive vibe to it.&quot; \n\nHodges, Allan, and Dioguardi also recorded a live demo version, which can be viewed on\n\nThe music video for &quot;Had It All&quot; was filmed in Saugus, California on August 19 by Cyril Guyot.
