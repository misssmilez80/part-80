The new scene rules sucks big time. Look at our last nukes.      |\n|  Radio Express isn't a valid store anymore. It's true, Radio Express       |\n|  isn't a normal shop, it's a radio service, delivering promo's. You got    |\n|  to have a licence to have access, work for radio or be a registered       |\n|  prof. DJ. What happened to the scene lately ? The scene used to be the    |\n|  place to find all the latest promo's before they were in the stores.      |\n|  Isn't that allowed anymore ? We are now in  2011, record companies won't  |\n|  deliver promo cds anymore, it's all downloaded. And Radio Express is one  |\n|  of those places. So how can we tag this rls ? As a -PROMO_WEB- ? That     |\n|  option seems to be forgotten in the latest rules. We were never asked to  |\n|  discuss about those new scene rules, and we didn't sign them either       |\n|  (never asked). So we are left with one option, to release all our Radio   |\n|  Express and Radio Ventures stuff as an -INT-. We are not happy about      |\n|  this, makes us sad and frustrated, we used to do this for fun. But        |\n|  where's the fun lately ?                                                  |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------+------------------------------------------+----------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6122b9c994daeb3e8bd34c2cf51dcc889361ddf","amp;dn":"VA-Radioplay_Dance_Express_919D-2011-SC_INT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6122b9c994daeb3e8bd34c2cf51dcc889361ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,18,43,156,153,77,174,179,232,189,52,194,207,81,220,200,137,54,29,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
