(User Account Control)\nThe Application allows each user to maintain individual settings while at the same time seamlessly integrating any administrative commands directly into the users account. New users accounts are detected upon opening the Application and automatically inherit the Administrators settings.\n\nCodecs have been a problem for most users at one time or another.\nThis is because there has never been an 'out of the box' working solution that the average computer user could install and just have everything work properly from the beginning. There are several decent codec package solutions out there, but none of them did everything I wanted. I was always in need of a tweak, adjustment, or even a re-installation just to get the codecs I needed/wanted and most of the time, the file still didn't play properly.\nI've never claimed to be a media guru.\nMy media experience prior to creating these packages was to double-click a file I downloaded and hope that it played.\n\nThe installer will automatically remove most other popular codec releases from your computer before installing this concise yet comprehensive package.\nYou won't need to make any adjustments or tweaks to enjoy your media content immediately. Windows Media Player and Media Center will instantly recognize all your files as playable. \n\nIt does not contain a media player and it does not associate file-types.\nWith this package installed you will be able to use any media player, limited only by the players' capabilities, to play all movies and video clips.\nStreaming video is supported in several formats in all popular web browsers.\nUsers of the Win7codecs have the ability to choose what is installed and where to install it using the public redistributable.\nAfter installation you can select to remove specific portions without removing the entire package. You can also re-add the removed items at any time.\n\nThis package supports 20 localizations.\nThe default is English and the installer includes support for the following other languages; Arabic, Chinese Simplified/Traditional, Japanese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Polish, Swedish and Turkish. \n\n\nUNINSTALL YOUR OLD VERSION  - upgrades are enabled but not recommended\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.2.3:\n\n\nUpdate FFDShow to rev 3036\n\nUpdate Gabests splitters to rev 1179\n\nUpdater Musepack support for SV8 streams\n\nAdd MediaInfo interface to the Settings Application\n\nAllow the file renderer to open All Files\n\nDisable installation onto unsupported systems\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.2.2:\n\n\nRemove Xiph Ogg Codecs\n\nImprove support for older CPU's\n\nAllow AC3Filter to be turned Off/On\n\nAllow XviD decoder to be turned Off/On\n\nUpdate Gabest splitters to 1168\n\nEnable thumbnailing OGG/OGM\n\nAdd splitter selections for OGG/OGM\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.2.1:\n\n\nImprove DTS audio in ALL containers\n\nImprove audio type detection\n\nAllow Haali to be turned Off/On\n\nAllow FFDShow to be turned Off/On\n\nUpdate FFDShow to rev 3029\n\nMANY changes to the Settings Application\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.2.0:\n\n\nUpdates Gabests filters to 1164\n\nUpdate FFDShow to rev 3020\n\nAdd codec testing tool to MISC TAB\n\nPrevious version MUST be uninstalled\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.9:\n\n\nUpdates Gabests filters to 1161\n\nUse stable revision of FFDShow\n\nFix DirectVobSub Styles conflict /x64\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.8:\n\n\nAdd Arabic language support\n\nAdd Danish language support\n\nAdd icons for non-native filetypes\n\nUse a stable revision of FFDShow\n\nUpdates Gabests filters to 1156\n\nSettings Application bug fixes\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.7.1 Final:\n\n\nCreate a 100% stable release\n\nRevert FFDShow for stability\n\nUpdate XviD to SVN 1.2.2\n\nUpdate the settings application\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.7:\n\n\nUpdate ffdshow rev 2719\n\nUpdate Gabest to rev 1004\n\nFix memory leak in DXVA codec\n\nMinor changes to default settings\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.6:\n\n\nFix explorer crash in Win7codecs 1.1.5\n\nUpdate FFDShow to SVN rev 2975\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.5:\n\n\nUpdate Gabest SVN rev 1125\n\nUpdate FFDShow to SVN rev 2972\n\nUpdate XviD to SVN rev 1.3.0\n\nImprove thumbnail support\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.4:\n\n\nUpdate Gabest rev 1111\n\nRevert FFDShow to a stable version\n\nAdd new functionality to Settings App\n\nAdd filetype icons for WMP associations\n\nSeveral improvements for the settings app\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Win7codecs 1.1.3:\n\n\nUpdate FFDShow rev 2943\n\nUpdate Gabest rev 1101\n\nAdd new functions to Settings App\n\nImplement filetype associations for WMP\n\nAssociations can be reverted to previous state\n\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nThis is a freeware codec package specially complied for Windows 7 :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97096dfae5d4f8c4fb718f039f9caab6e9357fba","amp;dn":"Win7codecs+1.2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97096dfae5d4f8c4fb718f039f9caab6e9357fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,9,109,250,229,212,248,196,251,113,143,3,159,156,170,182,233,53,127,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
