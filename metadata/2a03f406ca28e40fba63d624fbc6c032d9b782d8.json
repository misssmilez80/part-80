The sounds is not as rough as that of Skinny Puppy and the sounds are not as polished as that of sunth pop bands. There are many good tracks on this album, for instance lovely day, body to body to mention a few. Commando mix is also great but I wonder what song it is a commando mix of. The covert art was state of the art computer graphics at the time and replaced the less then inspiring first cover. There is no booklet at all and I find that to be a cheap move on beahalf of Play it Again Sam Records. The photos in the sleeve look like they were taken by friends and not by a photographer. This is a very well produced and recorded album that I highly reccomend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a03f406ca28e40fba63d624fbc6c032d9b782d8","amp;dn":"Front+242+-+%281992%29+No+Comment+1984-1985+%5BEK+52404%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a03f406ca28e40fba63d624fbc6c032d9b782d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,3,244,6,202,40,228,15,186,99,214,36,251,198,192,50,217,183,130,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
