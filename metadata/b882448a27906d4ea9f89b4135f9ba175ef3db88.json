The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files.\n\n\n\n      The Modern Jazz Quartet And Orchestra  (Atlantic LP 1359)\nMilt Jackson (vib) John Lewis (p) Percy Heath (b) Connie Kay (d) Werner Heider, Gunther Schuller (cond) unidentified large symphony orchestra\nStuttgart, West Germany, June 3, 1960\n\n\n4619\tEngland's Carol (God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen)\n4620\tDivertimento\nsame personnel\nStuttgart, West Germany, June 4, 1960\n4621\tAround The Blues\n4622\tConcertino For Jazz Quartet And Orchestra: 1st Movement\n4623\tConcertino For Jazz Quartet And Orchestra: 3rd Movement\n4624\tConcertino For Jazz Quartet And Orchestra: 2nd Movement - Passacaglia\n** also issued on Atlantic SD 1359.
