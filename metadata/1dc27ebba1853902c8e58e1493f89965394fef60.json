Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) may lack in the skills that their chieftain is looking for, but they have plans to make it big. Zed has a gut feeling that God has &quot;chosen&quot; him, and so he leads his buddy on a trip through the unknown countryside in search of bigger and better things, bumping into several weird characters along the way -- like a feuding pair of brothers named Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd). Unfortunately, their quest for greatness hits a few snags, like being sold into slavery, and later becoming the object of interest to a very amorous, very hairy high priest (Oliver Platt) in the opulent city of Sodom.\n\n\nCast\n  (Cast overview, first billed only)\n\n\tJack Black\t... \tZed\n\n\tMichael Cera\t... \tOh\n\n\tOliver Platt\t... \tHigh Priest\n\n\tDavid Cross\t... \tCain\n\n\tChristopher Mintz-Plasse\t... \tIsaac\n\n\tVinnie Jones\t... \tSargon\n\n\tHank Azaria\t... \tAbraham\n\n\tJuno Temple\t... \tEema\n\n\tOlivia Wilde\t... \tPrincess Inanna\n\tJune Diane Raphael\t... \tMaya\n\n\tXander Berkeley\t... \tKing\n\n\tGia Carides\t... \tQueen\n\tHoratio Sanz\t... \tEnmebaragesi\n\n\tDavid Pasquesi\t... \tPrime Minister\n\n\tMatthew Willig\t... \tMarlak (as Matthew J.
