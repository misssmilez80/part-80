HAVE FUN! and if you have a copy of sneek v0.2 please upload it.\n\nSNEEK v 0.1 (SD-NAND/ES-Emulation Kit) by crediar (10/10/2009)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany tanks to ajd4096 who donated me an USBGecko!\nThanks to the anonymous guy who helped me with the FS module!\n\nWARNING:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYOU AGREE THAT YOU INSTALL THIS TOOL ON YOUR OWN RISK, THE AUTHOR CAN NOT BE HELD\nRESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY EITHER USING OR INSTALLING THIS TOOL.\n\n\nWhat is SNEEK and what the hell does it do:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoughly said SNEEK redirects all NAND access to SD and also has its own ES module\nwhich already emulates most of the ES calls but does not check any signatures or\nversions of installed titles.\n\nThe ES module also automatically adjusts to the IOS version the current title\nrequests.\n\nAs long as SNEEK is running NO changes are applied to the NAND.\nIt outputs a lot of debug information via USBGecko i.e. what ES calls are being made.\n\nNote about the release:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSNEEK has been private for a long time now (the FS module is already four months old)\nthe ES module got created last month due a problem with a Wii I own.\nIt had a broken NAND and nothing more than BootMii would work so I created the ES\nmodule.\n\nI thought maybe others also got a use for it since it also allows to take your NAND\nover to a friend who also got SNEEK installed, or simpler things like messing with\nsave files or modifing other stuff.\n\nBecause mini is released under GNU GPL v2 it is required to also supply the source\nthat's why mini-tree-src.rar is included in this package.\n\n\nKnown problems:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDue the way it works it breaks any SD access on the PPC side. Since a few apps can't\nhandle that no /dev/sdio device is present SNEEK emulates that with no SD card being\ninserted.\n\nBut it is still possible to access the whole SD card through ISFS functions i.e.\nISFS_Open(&quot;/music/awesome.mp3&quot;, 1 ); so you got at least SD access for homebrew stuff\nif the authors add it.\n\nSystem menu settings crash. Data management works.\nWii-Disc loading via System menu doesn't work, GC-Disc work (if BS/MIOS are present).\nWii-Disc loading works via custom loaders.\n\nSince this is emulation random crashes might occur and some stuff might not work.\n\n\nRequirements:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBefore you can use SNEEK you need a few additional things:\n\n-SD/SDHC card\n-IOS60 v6174 (TMD, ticket and decrypted(!) content files)\n-a NAND FS dump\n\n-BootMii installed as boot2(!) (optional)\n-an USBGecko  (optional)\n\n\nNotes on the install methods:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe BootMii install offers the best way of running SNEEK since it directly runs on\nboot up and does not require any modifications of the NAND.\n\nThe IOS-Install needs to be install on the NAND and the IOS needs to be called by an\napplication before SNEEK can start.\n\n\nBootMii-Install:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nModifying IOS60\n-remove the SD module entry from the TMD and reduce the content count by one\n-change the TitleID within the TMD and the ticket to 00000001-000000FA\n\nCreate the 0000000e.app/boot2.bin\n-run the following commands\n\n(Note: if you want you can use the ES or the FS module without the other,\nsimply do &quot;elfins.exe  0000000e.app&quot;)\n\nelfins.exe esmodule.elf 0000000e tmp.bin\nelfins.exe fsmodule.elf tmp.bin 0000000e.app\n\nboot2me.exe 0000000e.app boot2.bin\n\n-now copy the boot2.bin to the root of your SD card\n-copy the supplied BootMii folder to your SD card, you might want to backup the\n content first!\n\nCreate SNEEK FS structure on NAND\n-copy your NAND FS to the root of the SD card\n-create this folder structure:\n/title/00000001/0000000fa/content/\n-copy the IOS60 content files with the TMD into that folder\n-copy the created 0000000e.app to that folder as well\n-rename the TMD to title.tmd\n-copy the IOS60 ticket to /ticket/00000001/000000fa.tik\n\nnow SNEEK should be fully working and boot up the system menu\n\n\nIOS-Only-Install:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nModifying IOS60\n-remove the SD module entry from the TMD and reduce the content count by one\n-change the TitleID within the TMD and the ticket to 00000001-000000FA\n\nCreate the 0000000e.app\n-run the following commands\n\n(Note: if you want you can use the ES or the FS module without the other,\nsimply do &quot;elfins.exe  0000000e.app&quot;)\n\nelfins.exe esmodule.elf 0000000e tmp.bin\nelfins.exe fsmodule.elf tmp.bin 0000000e.app\n\nCreating and installing the SNEEK.wad\nWhen running SNEEK via the IOS-Install you have to install it via a .wad\nthere are many tutorials on the net on how to create a wad and how to install them\n\nCreate SNEEK FS structure on NAND\n-copy your NAND FS to the root of the SD card\n-create this folder structure:\n/title/00000001/0000000fa/content/\n-copy the IOS60 content files with the TMD into that folder\n-copy the created 0000000e.app to that folder as well\n-rename the TMD to title.tmd\n-copy the IOS60 ticket to /ticket/00000001/000000fa.tik\n\n\nas soon as you load IOS250 via any method it should load and load the system menu\n\n\nChange default boot up title:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy default the system menu (1-2) is booted, if you want to boot another title by\ndefault create a file called &quot;/sys/default.sys&quot; on your SD card and write the\ntitle ID as hex into it (not as text!!)\n\n\nUninstall:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSimply restore your BootMii folder on your SD card.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ecbdfd01c0e812c2a9ccbf4bc520178da5ee9b","amp;dn":"Sneek+Beta+v0.1+%28Wii+Nand+Emulation%2FForwarder%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95ecbdfd01c0e812c2a9ccbf4bc520178da5ee9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,236,189,253,1,192,232,18,194,169,204,191,75,197,32,23,141,165,238,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
