(2001)\n   \n        Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but\n\tthey are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by\n\tchildren, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley\n\tfinds his world disrupted.\n\n        R I P P E R ' S   N O T E S \n  \n        Main Movie :\n         --&gt; Video - x264 Core 66 r1271M, 7.4 Mbps,\n                     1080p, 23.976 fps, Level 4.0\n                     (DVXA Compatible)\n         --&gt; Audio - English 6.1 DTS MA Lossless 1.87 Mbps, Latin \n\t\t     Spanish AC3 5.1 AC3 640 Kbps, English Comments\n\t\t     2.0 192 Kbps\n         --&gt; Subs  - English, Spanish, Forced Spanish, Spanish\n\t\t     Comments\n         --&gt; Size  - 7.33 GBs\n                     (7.93 GBs after lossless BD5 conversion)\n         --&gt; Note  - &quot;MVASubs&quot; folder is needeed for BD5 conversion.\n\t\t     New TSmuxer version (1.10.6) is used for\n\t\t     conversion, may affect compatibility with\n                     certain players.\n\t\t     Std. dev. weighted mean: HIGH (0.994720)\n\nABOUT BD5/BD9\n\n   Where does this play?\n           \n   -&gt; BD5/BD9 is meant for playback on pc/popcorn/htpc/ps3/bluray-player\n            \n   How does it work?\n           \n    -&gt;  For playback on pc simply extract and play the mkv in your favorite player.\n        another option is to create the bluray/image for playback with powerdvd.\n    -&gt;  For playback on ps3/bluray-player run &quot;Convert to BD5.exe&quot; and chose &quot;B&quot;.\n        This will convert the mkv to bluray and create an image that will play\n        in the PS3 or a Bluray Player.\n           \n    How's the quality?\n           \n    -&gt; Qualiy is to be considered the same as BluRay releases.\n             \n    Why is BD5/BD9 &quot;undersized&quot;?\n           \n    -&gt; The conversion to bluray takes up some 200-300MB (500-600MB for BD9)\n       space which is the bluray overhead. Because of this the mkv is sligthly\n       &quot;undersized&quot;.\n                \n    Why doesn't everything get released as BD5/BD9?\n           \n    -&gt; We don't know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other\n       groups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing\n       incompatible BluRay releases.
