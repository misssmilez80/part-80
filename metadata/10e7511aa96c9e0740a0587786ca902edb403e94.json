Basically this means-11.04 Ubuntu for Those IGPs with Intel i915 or newer, most all ATI Radeon graphics processors except for the newest Radeon HD 6000 series, and Potentially Most NVIDIA graphics cards. Right now Ubuntu does not enable the Gallium3D Nouveau driver by default, But They May enable it to bring the experience to Unity NVIDIA users . Once Ubuntu is installed off the LiveCD and Any proprietary graphics drivers are installed, the Unity can run in other desktop configurations. For Those with 3D drivers by default in Ubuntu, the first six screenshots show what looks like the desktop in Ubuntu 11.4 Alpha 3.\n\nIt does not look too different from the Ubuntu Netbook 10.10 Edition interface and it is Still Far From Being Finished. Also there are comments from CanonicalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Rick Spencer about the state of Unity in Ubuntu 11.4 Alpha 3 . The big improvement in Ubuntu 11.4 Alpha 3 Compared to Unity at 10:10 Is that the Ubuntu desktop is not as sluggish, But there is still plenty of room for improvement. Overall, though, Canonical still has lots of work ahead to get ready for Unity Ubuntu 11.04. Unity in Ubuntu 4.11 will not use Also Wayland display by default as the ITS server, But That Will Come later .\n\nFor Those Lacking 3D acceleration support When running Ubuntu 11.04, you will fall back to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclassicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ GNOME desktop (shown above) that really is not different from previous Ubuntu Linux releases. The GNOME 3.0 Shell Also Requires OpenGL support with ITS Mutter window manager, I know That is not used either. A message box primitive Appears When this happens Informing You That You Lack the Necessary support 3D acceleration to run Ubuntu Unity. To Those Without Any 3D acceleration hardware or drivers, the driver Gallium3D-based LLVMpipe That Is Able to accelerated OpenGL on the CPU (and other trackers Gallium3D been) better as a software renderer, still does not yet support the Necessary requirements to run Compiz, KWin, now Mutter.\n\nThe experience with compositing window manager LLVMpipe though Would be quite slow with all But The Most recent CPUs. Ideally though NVIDIA users will get support Nouveau Gallium3D Natty by default, since the Gallium3D Nouveau-less experience in Ubuntu 4.11 Alpha 3 right now is quite poor and with the Gallium3D Actually Worse Than component enabled. Moving around in the classic Windows desktop is GNOME and Takes a noticeable slow time for the regions behind the move window to be repainted, etc.. Gallium3D Nouveau is slow at gaming , But Our tests show it working out just fine for the desktop with Most generations of NVIDIA GPUs.\n\n\n\n\nuploaded by g0d on -&gt; king-torrent\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nAll packs are CLEAN 100%\nScanned  with Avast Antivirus Internet Security (2011).\nIf you find something with other AV prog\nI DONT ANSWER in any comments.\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e7511aa96c9e0740a0587786ca902edb403e94","amp;dn":"ubuntu+11.4+alpha+3+desktop+edition+x32+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e7511aa96c9e0740a0587786ca902edb403e94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,231,81,26,169,108,158,7,64,160,88,119,134,202,144,46,219,64,62,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
