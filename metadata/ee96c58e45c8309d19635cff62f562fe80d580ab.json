Werken's company to ensure that every product\navailable on the market is safe for humankind. He diligently\ncrashes, smashes, checks, re-checks and re-re-checks        \neverything from lemonade to escalators. Like most of us at one\npoint or another, CID thinks that there must more to life than\njust work. He's happy enough to put up with it, but he can't\nhelp thinking that there's something... else.               \n                                                            \nCID is a young, funky Crash Impact Dummy. He knows he's cool,\nhe knows he's street, he knows he's widdit. He's not really \nsure where he's heading in life. He kinda knows he's destined\nfor bigger things, but he's stuck in this damn job! He's got a\nquick sense of humour, and uses his wit as a defence.       \n                                                            \nInteract as only a crash impact dummy can. Climb walls, swing\non ropes, burn obstacles, destroy exploding barrels, use    \nlifters, bounce on springs and with a neat head butt destroy\nwalls all in stunningly realised environments. Game         \nenvironment interaction is the most important part of the   \ngameplay.                                                   \n                                                            \nCID's world is swarming with a host of fearfully fun enemies\nlike the Dumper, Cursed Dummy and the bizarre Failed        \nExperiment.                                                 \n                                                            \nApart from fighting enemies, the player will enjoy solving  \npuzzles, avoiding traps and using acrobatic skills to get out\nof dangerous situations!                                    \n\n\nInstall Notes:\n1.
