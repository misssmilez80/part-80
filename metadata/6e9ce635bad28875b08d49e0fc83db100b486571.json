It is a made-for-television docudrama written and directed by Martyn Burke which documents the rise of the home computer (personal computer) through the rivalry between Apple Computer and Microsoft.\n\nEDITS: I have recolored the movie, from another torrent. It took about 8 hours for the process to finish, but here it is. I recolored it because the color black was very faded, and colors wouldn't seem as bright as they should.\n\nWARNING! This is a low quality video. It is from 1999 VHS tapes, after all. Don't go ratting me out for bad quality. I tried to improve it.\n\n .|'''.|  '||''''|  '||''''|  '||''|.   \n ||..

If you don't seed, this torrent will die, and this recolor would have been useless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9ce635bad28875b08d49e0fc83db100b486571","amp;dn":"Pirates+Of+Silicon+Valley++%281999%29+%28Recolored%29+%28LQ%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9ce635bad28875b08d49e0fc83db100b486571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,156,230,53,186,210,136,117,176,141,73,224,252,131,219,16,11,72,101,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
