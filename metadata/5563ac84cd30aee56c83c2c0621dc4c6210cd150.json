Fixed: Cannot change the partition when copying files using the \n            function key due to navigation buttons removed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ 1.5.11 Release note\n\nChanges from 1.5.10\n\n    1) Player\n        1.\tBetter support for EXIF rotation information in Jpeg files\n        2.\tChange back to old icon size (200*200) for normal and Album Jacket \n            mode \n            (We referred to the 1.5.10 feedback, which all preferred 200x200 \n            size rather than new 120x120 size. Video folder icon size will \n            remain as previous version 1.5.10 which is 138x186)\n\n        3.\tThe play button is the default button on the synopsis page. \n            (remote controller focus will be on PLAY button not BACK button)\n        4.\tNow, the icon mode change with FUNCTION key on the remote works on \n            text mode folders. (It worked only when all the three mode was text\n            mode in 1.5.10)\n        5.\tMore Video cover folders are added\n            If a name of folder, which on the root folder, is starts with one\n            of below words(case insensitive), it will shows Video cover art mode\n            instead a normal icon mode.\n            -&quot;video&quot;, &quot;movie&quot;, &quot;dvd&quot;, &quot;bluray&quot;, &quot;blu-ray&quot;, &quot;film&quot;,\n             &quot;cinema&quot;, animation&quot;, &quot;drama&quot;, &quot;miniseries&quot;, &quot;tv series&quot;,\n              &quot;music video&quot;\n        6.\tRearrange the file list page for some severe over scan displays. \n            Depends on the display, there could be still be some hiding at the \n            edges.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ 1.5.10 Release note\n\nChanges from 1.4.26\n\n    1) Player\n        1. Subtitle loading speed has been improved.\n        2. Audio playlist now supports up to 8192 files.\n        3. Navigation UI Enhanced. (Not supported on UPnP)\n            A. The disc navigation removed from the top of the list UI. To \n               navigate to USB, Network, UPnP, a user need to press GOTO key \n               while you browse, then the navigation popup will be shown.\n \n            B. Users can select TEXT or more graphical interface mode for each \n               of Video, Audio and Photo on the Setup-Misc.\n               For Audio and Photo folders, album art and thumbnail mode will \n               behave similar to the Icon mode and the Thumbnail mode of our \n               old firmware, But for video, Cover art mode behaves differently \n               from older firmware. Other then video folders behave differently. \n \n               For Audio,\n                   1. Any folders named 'Audio', 'Automp3' and 'Music' (case \n                      insensitive) under the root folder will be shown as an \n                      icon mode (9 columns x 4 rows) with the icon size \n                      120*120(pixels) so if the folder.jpg(Folder.jpg, \n                      folder.png) size is 120*120, the icon will be shown \n                      without scale. (Coincidently, Windows Media Player save \n                      the covers as Folder.jpg)\n \n                   2. The folder which has no subfolder will be shown as list \n                      mode, so users can see file names easily. (Background \n                      image is the tvix.jpg on the folder, background image may\n                      differ in actual firmware, please replace with your \n                      choice of preference)\n                  \n                   3. Now, jpg files which start with 'albumart' \n                      ('albumartxxxx~xxx.jpg) will not be shown on the list. \n                      However, these will be shown as an icon when you press \n                      INFO button while you play music. If you have many \n                      albumartxxx~xxxx.jpg files in your folder, these files \n                      will be shown sequentially in time.\n\n                For Photo,\n                   1. Any folders named 'Photo' or 'Picture' on the root folder\n                      will be shown as Thumbnail UI (9 columns x 4 rows).\n \n                For Video, \n                   1. Any folders named 'Video', 'dtv_rec', 'DVD' and 'Bluray'\n                      under the root folder will be shown as a Cover art mode \n                      (8 columns x 3 rows). The size of the icon is 138x186 \n                      pixels.\n \n                   2. When user enters to a folder, (this folder should be \n                      located under folder named 'Video', 'Dtv_rec', 'Dvd' or \n                      'Bluray'), TVIX will show a default synopsis page and \n                      three buttons at the top of the screen which are Back, \n                      Preview and Play. This is no magic. TViX just shows \n                      tvix.jpg file in that folder as a background with three \n                      buttons(Back,Preview,Play) overlaid on it. So, users need\n                      to prepare appropriate tvix.jpg files according the \n                      content in that folder. If there are sub folders then \n                      TViX will show folders and files as icons and will not \n                      display synopsis page. So, you need to delete any \n                      subfolders to see tvix.jpg as a synopsis.\n\n                   3. If the folder has a file which name starts with \n                      'preview_', then the Preview button will be enabled and \n                      when a user select the Preview button, the file will be \n                      played. After playing it, a synopsis page will be shown.\n \n                   4. When a user select the Play button, if there is only one\n                      file, a file will be played. If there is more than one \n                      file, the file list will be shown so a user can select. \n                \n                   5. While you watch video, you can see the synopsis by \n                      pressing the guide key on the remote.\n\n                   So recommended folder structure for movies will be\n\n                   Movie_A\n                       movie_A.mkv (main movie file)\n                       preview_movie_A.mkv (preview file) \n                       (You do not need to have preview_movie_A.mkv, it is \n                       optional)\n                       folder.jpg (cover art file)\n                       tvix.jpg (Synopsis file)\n\n\n                   if your movie files are more than two.\n\n                   Movie_B\n                       movie_b1.mkv\n                       movie_b2.mkv\n                       preview_movie_b.mkv\n                       folder.jpg\n                       tvix.jpg\n                       tvix2.jpg \n                       (the background image that appears with the movie file\n                       list when you press &quot;PLAY&quot; button. if you do not have \n                       it, default dark background image will be displayed )\n\n\n    2) DTV\n        1.    Now color space option, which is on Video option, will be used.\n        2.    Some UI bug has been fixed.\n        3.    Fixed: In some case, TVIX reboot when DTV stops.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ 1.4.26 Release note\n\nChanges from 1.4.15\n\n    1) Player\n        - Fixed: Cannot navigate by selecting [Up folder] after playing picture \n                   files.\n        - Improved : Now use Folder.jpg as an icon on Icon browse mode, so if \n                   users get album covers using Windows Mediaplayer, these folder \n                   icons will be used as icons.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ 1.4.25 Release note\n\nChanges from 1.4.22\n\n    1) Player\n        - When used with some TVs, screen flickers and becomes black after a few\n          seconds. This happens very irregualry, so it is hard to debug.\n          We think it's SDK(Software Develpment Kit) bug from Sigmadesigns. So, \n          we did some work around. When this happen, please press &quot;VIDEO&quot; button \n          once and it will become nomal.(It is hard to check whether it solves \n          the problem because we only have one monitor (out of 100 TVs and \n          monitors ) that can reproduce the problem but it happens once in days.\n          The SDK that the firmware 1.2.52 based upon does not have this problem \n          but we cannot go back to this SDK because it has other bugs including \n          not outputing HD audio output through optical or coax. \n        - Fixed: The audio file tag info is broken. Does not show APE and CUE \n                 tags.\n        - Fixed: The Prev and Next key does not work as paging while music play.\n        - Fixed: The audio album jacket is not shown on the info page when \n                 an audio file is selected from icon mode\n        - Improved: Now, shows the audio jacket files on the folder of currently\n                 playing file in the Audio info page. \n    2) ETC\n        - Fixed: Cannot copy large size files over SAMBA.\n        - Fixed: System reboot when user try to remount local HDD after copy \n                 files through FTP.\n \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ 1.4.22 Release note\n\nChanges from 1.4.19\n\n    1) Player\n        - Fixed: Bookmarks are not saved sometimes.\n        - Fixed: Cannot play M4V files.\n        - Fixed: The audio album jacket is not shown on the info page when an \n                 audio file is being played.\n        - Fixed: The chapter title is not shown on the info while a MKV file \n                 with chapters info is being played.\n        - Fixed: When the bookmark key is pressed while a MKV file with chapters \n                 info, the chapter titles are not shown on the chapter selection \n                 popup.\n        - Fixed: The 'Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½' is not shown for the Cyrillic subtitle.\n        - Fixed: The setup menu shows strange characters when OSD Language is \n                 Vietnamese.\n\n    2) DTV\n        - Fixed: The scheduled recording does not start.\n        - Fixed: TVIX is not stable if user switch between DTV and player \n                 frequently.\n        - Fixed: The DTV does not start with the last watching channel.\n\n    Kown issue for UTF8 supports,\n        Does not supports Arabic correctly, and we don't have plan to support \n        this for now.\n\n    * Known issues for Video related\n        - When HD Audio pass-through is on with HD audio stream, S/PDIF does \n          not work\n        - When HD Audio pass-through is off with HD audio stream, playback may \n          not be smooth\n        - When DTS audio setting is digital, HDMI audio is ON and HD audio \n          pass-through is set to ON, then audio is not heard on the SPDIF \n          output (For the same setting, if HDMI audio is set to OFF, then audio \n          is HEARD on the SPDIF output.)\n        - Some WMV may not play correctly\n        - Digital output for AAC/WMA is disabled\n        - Does not support PCM audio track on MP4 now\n        - Some MKV with AAC may not sound\n    \n    * Known issues for TS/TP Video related\n        - The type of PGS language is not showed.\n        - Some TS/TP may not sound.\n        - It is a new TS/TP player written by us not using SDK code.

It is because mounting ISO as a\n              drive overhead is too much for 6500 CPU. So, it looks like \n              hardware limitation. We are trying to optimize it but it may not \n              result to success.\n            # We recommend to use IFO structure.\n            # If you play files without refreshing the file list after delete \n              files through FTP or SAMBA server, the system will reboot.\n            # 1G option may or may not work better than 10/100M mode depends on \n              the network environment\n    \n    * Known issues for PVR\n        - After channel changed, you may not here audio in short time.
