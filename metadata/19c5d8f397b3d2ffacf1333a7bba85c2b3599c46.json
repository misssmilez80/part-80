SSW Code\n   Auditor is a code analysis tool that allows developers to take\n   control of your code, ensuring large, complex source code can be\n   simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in rules focus on the most popular\n   NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms and ASP.NET;\n   however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to add\n   their own rules to target any language in any text file.\n   As a project or company grows, managing code standards throughout\n   your team becomes virtually impossible. Consistent code is crucial to\n   future development and maintenance. SSW Code Auditor lets you take\n   control of your code and automatically review your web apps and projects\n   giving you more opportunity to spend time where it really matters.\n   Here at SSW, we face the problem of maintaining our standards across\n   nearly five thousand web pages, over twenty active projects in both\n   Visual Basic (6 and .NET) and C#. There comes a point where a tool to\n   check our work is needed, this tool is SSW Code Auditor.\n   SSW Code Auditor utilizes the power of Regular Expressions to audit\n   your code. This powerful feature permits the user to write their own set\n   of rules and have different rules for different projects.\n   \n\n\n        \n\n Installation:\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n  \n   Just unpack&amp;install. Use included keygen to make valid unlock code(s).\n\n\n        \n\n Greetz:\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n\n        \n\n Contact Us:\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19c5d8f397b3d2ffacf1333a7bba85c2b3599c46","amp;dn":"SSW.Code.Auditor.v13.33-BEAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19c5d8f397b3d2ffacf1333a7bba85c2b3599c46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,197,216,243,151,179,210,255,172,241,51,58,123,186,133,194,179,89,156,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
