It protects your important data by backing it up automatically to any USB/Firewire device, local or network location. The backed up data can be either compressed (using standard zip compression) or an exact copy of the original files.\n\nA special advantage of A-PDF Backup Master is the possibility to backup single files and groups of files, for example for important or confidential documents. The program can also store different versions of your files. This can be useful if you would like to restore a certain version of your file at a later date.\n\nWhy A-PDF Backup Master\n\nA-PDF Backup Master allows you to copy, upload, download data automatically on schedule from your PC to various storages, network disks, remote FTP servers, etc. The program can either mirror your data &quot;as is&quot; or create archived files or directories for copying.\n\nA built-in task scheduler helps you to build a queue of automated backups, uploads, downloads, or run third-party utilities to process the data before or after copying/archiving.\n\nHome Page - http://www.a-pdf.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac7ce3c28d797af87ed829cda3db01d036df4dc0","amp;dn":"A-PDF.Backup.Master.v1.1.0.Cracked-REViSE+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac7ce3c28d797af87ed829cda3db01d036df4dc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,124,227,194,141,121,122,248,126,216,41,205,163,219,1,208,54,223,77,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
