MalyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar playing on the album is a pleasure to any blues fan, and he is aptly backed by his band to create a smart combination of toe-tapping rhythms and inspiring guitar melodies. The guitaristsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ raspy vocals on tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Just How MuchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeven DeadlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tops the sound of Guitar Jock off nicely, giving the album a classic blues feel.\n\nMaly does a great job changing out guitar and rhythm styles on Guitar Jock to bring a level of diversity to his songs that keeps each track sounding fresh. The opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Just How MuchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the title-song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGuitar JockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are anchored by the impressive soloing of Maly. However, he adds in a second guitar line that makes the most of wah- wah pedal, giving the tracks an undeniable funk feel. \n\n\n\nMaly pulls this funky-blues sound off several times on Guitar Jock with a lot of success, most notably on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCinderellaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the correctly titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWah Wah Eyes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nOther songs on the LP have their roots in jazz as well as blues. The wailing key melodies of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeven DeadlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGuitar ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ showcase this aspect of MalyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound well. \n\nAt other times, Guitar Jock uses a more traditional blues sound. The simmering guitar melodies of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf You Were A Guitar,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHappy BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHistoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ leave no doubt that Maly is a talented blues musician. \n\nFans of country music will also find something to like on the record. The twangy melodies of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCountry GirlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet-ter BugÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ build a rockabilly vibe that country fans will find hard not to get along with.\n\nNo matter what kind of stylistic changes Ed Maly uses on Guitar Jock, he has success with all of them. The album is a unique take on the blues that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy. \n\n4/5 Stars\n\nMuzikReviews.com Assistant Senior Editor- Chris Homer\n\nApril 30, 2009\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© MuzikReviews.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4903d79b7959f66a0089df4a400a343078439e9","amp;dn":"Ed+Maly+-+Guitar+Jock+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4903d79b7959f66a0089df4a400a343078439e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,144,61,121,183,149,159,102,160,8,157,244,164,0,163,67,7,132,57,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
