I have never heard of him before, maybe some of you might have.  If so, I'd appreciate any additional info about this artist.  \n\nThis CD was purchased in Mexico many years ago. I listened to it for some time then I forgot it existed anymore.  Just recently I rediscovered it again and decided to get more info on the web.  To my surprise, there was nothing!  \n\nThis is an easy listening type of music, kinda elevator lounge stuff, but it's played and produced masterfully.\n\nGive it a try. \n\n\nJean Pierre Pascal - Precio\n\n192 kbps, MP3 \n\nTrack Listing:  \n\n\n01.
