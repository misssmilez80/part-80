It contains 10 songs including hits such as &quot;Morning Has Broken,&quot; &quot;Moonshadow,&quot; and &quot;Peace Train.&quot; It is also the title of a children's book written and illustrated by Cat Stevens. The story features the title characters from the album cover, top-hatted young Teaser and his pet Firecat, who attempt to put the moon back in its place after it falls from the sky. Published in 1972, the book has been out of print since the mid-1970s.\n\nThe album was a commercial success, surpassing the heights achieved by Stevens' previous album, Tea for the Tillerman, reaching both the UK and US Top 3 and also spending an impressive fifteen weeks at the top of the Australian charts, becoming the biggest-selling album of the country in 1972\n\nSide one\n&quot;The Wind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42 \n&quot;Rubylove&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37 \n&quot;If I Laugh&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n&quot;Changes IV&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32 \n&quot;How Can I Tell You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 \n[edit] Side two\n&quot;Tuesday's Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36 \n&quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; (words Eleanor Farjeon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n&quot;Bitterblue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12 \n&quot;Moonshadow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52 \n&quot;Peace Train&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04 \n\n[edit] Personnel\nCat Stevens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, keyboards, vocals \nAlun Davies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar \nLarry Steele ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, congas \nGerry Conway ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \nHarvey Burns ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \nRick Wakeman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano on &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; (uncredited) \nAndreas Toumazis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bouzouki \nAngelos Harzipavli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bouzouki \nDel Newman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ string arrangements \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef021f4b20d4b7ab4640611f32d08b3a3ecc8ef","amp;dn":"cevens...Teaser+and+the+Firecat%281971%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ef021f4b20d4b7ab4640611f32d08b3a3ecc8ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,240,33,244,178,13,75,122,180,100,6,17,243,45,8,179,163,236,200,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
