Another fellow (Andy Garcia) steps into the gap and claims credit, and as his life changes for the better he takes on a messianic glow. Geena Davis is the cynical television reporter who pushes the latter's fame in order to keep her story alive, and this film, directed by Stephen Frears (Prick Up Your Ears), takes a few familiar jabs at a manipulative and voyeuristic press. This is essentially an unofficial remake of Meet John Doe, though it is less dramatic and forceful in the end than Frank Capra's classic. Chevy Chase has an oddly anachronistic part as Davis's editor (maybe he thought he really was in Meet John Doe), but the film belongs to Hoffman, who makes his character a slightly cleaned-up version of the actor's own Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy   \n\nImdb:..... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104412/ 6.3/10  Users: (10,956 votes) 60 reviews | Critics: 16 reviews\n        \nRuntime... 117 min     \n\nYear...... 1992        \n\nGengre....
