Records WAX 7127\nReleased 1998\n\n\nPsychic TV (sometimes spelled Psychick TV) or PTV, is a video art and music group that primarily performs psychedelic, punk, electronic and experimental music. The band was formed by performance artist Genesis P-Orridge and video director Peter Christopherson (after the break up of Throbbing Gristle) with Alex Fergusson, musician and producer (a key member of Alternative TV for whom P-Orridge had played percussion).\n\nThe band began publishing a monthly series of 23 live albums in 1986, but stopped without explanation after only 17. The tenth, a picture disk most commonly referred to as Album 10, could only be obtained by submitting tokens contained in each of the previous nine releases. The band subsequently earned an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for most records released in one year.\n\nContributors to Psychic TV have included artists such as Coil, Current 93, Hafler Trio, The Cult, White Stains, Soft Cell, Fred Giannelli, XKP, Master Musicians of Jajouka, Matthew Best, Daniel Simon Black, Bill Breeze, Hilmar ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œrn Hilmarsson, Derek Jarman, John Gosling, Timothy Leary, Rose McDowall, Stephen Kent, Vagina Dentata Organ, Andrew Weatherall, Larry Thrasher, Z'EV, Zef Noi$e, and many others.\n\n\nshare the music!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2789033982dc24d84ba3835432e17d4ee2cb104f","amp;dn":"Psychick+TV+-+Jack+The+Tab+Tekno+Acid+Beat+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2789033982dc24d84ba3835432e17d4ee2cb104f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,137,3,57,130,220,36,216,75,163,131,84,50,225,125,78,226,203,16,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
