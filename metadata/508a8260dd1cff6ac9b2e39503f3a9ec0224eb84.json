Loren Battle is without a doubt one of the fastest rising unsigned bands in recent memory. Independently selling over 5,000 copies of both records and having over 40,000 hits on their Cover of Lady Gaga's &quot;Paparazzi&quot; and reaching 1 on the MySpace Metalcore charts on numerous occasions, Loren Battle shows no signs of slowing down. With tour plans in motion for the majority of 2011, and a new full-length in the works, expect to see a lot more of Loren Battle in the near future.\n\nAlbum: Words Begin Wars\nBand: Loren Battle\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n#       Title              Length\n\n1.
