While conflicts in Korea and Vietnam dragged on, providing the traditional images of modern warfare, some of the conflict's most dangerous battles were invisible--tactical, intellectual, and fought primarily in the minds and war rooms of U.S. and Soviet leaders: Kennedy, Krushchev, Castro, Kissinger, Gorbachev, and Reagan. This 12-volume, 24-episode series, narrated by Kenneth Branagh, is a comprehensive history that examines the key events of the arc of the Soviet Union, from its birth to its fall, and provides a thorough analysis of what was going on behind closed doors. Informed by the stories of 500 eyewitnesses--from citizens and soldiers to historians and statesmen--and strengthened by painstaking reconstruction of archival historical film footage, CNN's Cold War is a heroic undertaking and a sweeping chronicle of the world's most fragile decades.\n\n\nDubbed from VHS @ 640x480 with an easycap DC60+, ffdshow, virtualdub and avidemux .\n\nAVI DETAILS: 9.60 Gb ( 24 x 409 Mb )\n\nVIDEO_BITRATE 1024\nVIDEO_CODEC_NAME XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVIDEO_DAR 1.500\nVIDEO_FRAMES_PER_SEC 29.970\nVIDEO_SIZE_X 720\nVIDEO_SIZE_Y 480\nAUDIO_BITRATE 192\nAUDIO_BITRATE_TYPE CBR\nAUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT 1 (unfortunately could only get a mono vcr)\nAUDIO_CODEC 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE 48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc227c8b908c19b22f294ce2211a6937837af6dc","amp;dn":"CNN+perspectives+presents+-+Cold+War+%2812+Tapes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc227c8b908c19b22f294ce2211a6937837af6dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,34,124,139,144,140,25,178,47,41,76,226,33,26,105,55,131,122,246,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
