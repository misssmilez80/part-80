By taking control of the press and by lying to the country they were able for 3 weeks to change the public's mind according to the opinion polls and Heath put the 72 EEC Act through and signed the treaty of Rome. \n\nWe started on day one to lose our constitution with 2000 new EEC Laws and the loss of our fishing grounds. Over the last 35 years our manufacturing industry has been destroyed, our food production industry has been destroyed, our armed forces have been so degraded that they cannot defend this country and we are shortly to be taken over completely by the EU. \n\nTreason is many things. You have read one of them, now go and read the rest of what constitutes treason and sedition. I did not get some police books. I owned them because I was a police constable and since then I have bought for myself a very good library of old books on English history and the constitutional law of this country, treason is what I have said it is and BLACK BLOODY TREASON IT IS.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763ec77e8ca62845ad897f379bc4067151160d9e","amp;dn":"Albert+Burgess%3A+Shoe-horned+into+the+European+Union","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763ec77e8ca62845ad897f379bc4067151160d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,62,199,126,140,166,40,69,173,137,127,55,155,196,6,113,81,22,13,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
