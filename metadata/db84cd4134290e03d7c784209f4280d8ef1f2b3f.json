You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender etc.\n\n\nIn theory this should have a 100% success rate on all machines.\n\n--\nGoogle for more infomation!\n\nBoth methods will work only i recommend a fresh install.\nTutorial for Upgrading:\n1. Mount this ISO. with for exemple: Daemon Tools Lite. I Recommend to Enable Auto Mound. )\n2. Just follow instructions of the DVD and skip product key.\n\n\nFor Fresh install:\nJust burn it with IsoBurn for exemple.\nand let your computer boot on DVD Drive.\n\nPlease Keep seeding and Commenting!\n\n\nKeep seeding till Ratio 2.0 Please..\n\n\nSo you can give people the chance to give something!\n\n\nGreetings, MoreFree Team\n\n\nEdit: Will add 64Bit soon...\n\nEdit: 28-11-09 11:50:\nI Quit Seeding.. My Ratio is over 2.0 and other people can seed a lot of faster then me.. But KEEP Seeding till ratio: 2.0\nCorrent Seeders: 300+\nCorrent Leechers: 800+\n\nPLEASE COMMENT AND QUALITY PLEASE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db84cd4134290e03d7c784209f4280d8ef1f2b3f","amp;dn":"Windows+7+-+All+Versions+-+32+Bit+-+Activated-MoreFree","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db84cd4134290e03d7c784209f4280d8ef1f2b3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,132,205,65,52,41,14,3,215,199,132,32,159,66,128,216,239,31,43,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
