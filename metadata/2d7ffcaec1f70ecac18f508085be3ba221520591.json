James Earl JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ One Man Show, a 1979 theatrical production, underlines how RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s art and politics were inextricably linked.\n\nJames Earl Jones One Man Show implies that the best way to understand Robeson is to meet him. Jones channels him in a two-hour, two-act play conceived as Robeson talking to the audience at an awards show. The occasion is Robeson being honored at Carnegie Hall at age 75, an event he did not attend, due to ill health and lingering bitterness over his treatment in the U.S. So we hear what Robeson might have been thinking as he watches his own enshrinement. He reviews his life experiences through stories, reenacted conversations, and songs.\n\nThat set-up is slightly awkward. For example, as the play opens, Jones sits, his back facing downstage as if he is an audience member, and then stands, turns, and begins his lengthy soliloquy. As he recounts his life from childhood to old age, Jones as Robeson is joined by Burt Wallace on piano for several musical numbers, so vibrant that they leave us wishing for more of these and fewer speeches.\n\nRobeson achieved international fame in the 1930s and 1940s as an actor and singer, starring in Show Boat and a version of Othello that set a record for the longest-running production of a Shakespeare play on Broadway. But he achieved even more fameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or notorietyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as an activist, traveling the world to speak out against fascism, African colonialism, U.S. racism, and the Cold War. In material drawn from RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s autobiography and letters, Jones encapsulates the iconÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beliefs in scientific socialism, peace, and a vision of racial unity.\n\nThe play vivifies RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s politics. Jones reenacts a scene where Robeson appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and fights for his right of free speech even as McCarthy and his crew banned his concerts, took away his passport, and turned the press and mainstream America against him. Jones delivers a sense of RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pain at that ostracism, as well as his passion as he rejects othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ attempts to make him a symbol. He tells his wife to stop calling him a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œheroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in her book about him. He responds with frustration when his parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ friends want to call him a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchild of destiny.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He cares more about others carrying on his social justice work after he is gone.\n\nThe play argues that his investment results from his own background. The son of a preacher and a teacher, he attends Rutgers on a football scholarship, the first black man to play for the team, confronting prejudice as he becomes an All-American sports star. He feels a recurring tension between one of his rebellious siblings, Reeves, and his father, who disagree over how best to respond to racism. While Reeves engages in militant rebellion (telling his brother, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever show fearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), his father claims dignity through religion, starting an African Methodist Episcopal church (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGo with your head, not your heartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). The show implies that Robeson drew on both perspectives. Though this opposition sometimes comes across like a pat, pop-psychological account of RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attitude, it does give the play a point of view, which saves it from simply recounting biography.\n\nWe learn that racial discrimination drove Robeson into his performance career, which he thought of as a form of resistance. Jones enacts RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s college singing experiences, as when the Rutgers Glee Club sing racist songs under RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s window for hours to harass him until Robeson sings back, louder and better. They finally ask him to audition for their group, even though he lacked formal training aside from singing in his church choir. After Columbia University law school, Robeson takes on Wall Street, abandoning it his law firm wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let him argue cases in court because of his race.\n\nJust when the play is in danger of becoming too pedantic, it shifts into an account of Robeson and his wife, Eslanda Cardozo Goode, the first black pathologist chemist at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Both were trendsetters in the Harlem Renaissance. Jones emphasizes the humor of their courtship as he delivers his side of their conversations, while weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re left to guess her side from context. He asks, What? YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re telling me we are to be married? Why would I marry you? and his next line is, So then we were married.\n\nThe second act turns more somber as it documents RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expatriate years. He performs in Show Boat in London, takes a harrowing 1934 trip through Nazi Germany, and then visits the Soviet Union, where he meets other international artists and sees a lack of racism in socialist societies. He travels to Spain during the Spanish Civil War to support anti-fascist efforts, makes political speeches at his concerts throughout Europe, and returns to the U.S. We run through a great deal of historical information here, and some of it blurs together. Still, the play successfully complicates a man who is usually reduced to icon. This is due in no small part to JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ powerful performance, bringing to life RobesonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal and political courage. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7ffcaec1f70ecac18f508085be3ba221520591","amp;dn":"Paul+Robeson+%28TV%29+%5B1979%5D+James+Earl+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7ffcaec1f70ecac18f508085be3ba221520591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,127,252,174,193,247,14,202,193,143,80,128,133,190,59,162,33,82,5,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
