A Whiter Shade of Pale [4:18]\n\nNotes: This outing, originally released on vinyl in 1981, was a forerunner in the do-it-yourself indie movement. The polished backing (including full band) and high-quality studio recording certainly don't sound &quot;low budget,&quot; though, and guest artists feature some of the finest players on the Kansas City scene. Beth's original songs include the award-winning &quot;Dance to Your Blues,&quot; the haunting &quot;(Have You Seen) Phillipa,&quot; and the rocking &quot;Lose Your Money.&quot; Her version of the classic &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale,&quot; with its spidery acoustic guitar motif, is spectacular. As one listener said, &quot;I never really understood this song before I heard Beth do it.&quot;\n\nBeth has been making solid independent recordings for a lot of years now, and this is where it started.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433a10d4052f0be76b44ddef7d23ac69a7d3c1f1","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Beth+Scalet+-+It%5C%27s+A+Living","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433a10d4052f0be76b44ddef7d23ac69a7d3c1f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,58,16,212,5,47,11,231,107,68,221,239,125,35,172,105,167,211,193,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
