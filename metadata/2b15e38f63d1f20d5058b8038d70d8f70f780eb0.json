These are the descendents of Davey Crockett, Daniel Boone, Loretta Lynn and Patsy Cline and the families of legendary soldiers and pioneers who helped open up the treacherous mountain passes and create an American continent. They are fighters steeped in family, ferocity and faith.\n\nFor nearly two years, ABC News cameras followed four Appalachian children, each one facing unimaginable obstacles. &quot;A Hidden America: Children of the Mountains&quot; is a continuation of Diane Sawyer's reporting on America's forgotten children. Sawyer won an Emmy for outstanding feature story in a news magazine for &quot;Waiting on the World to Change.\n\nMore decription: http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=6845770&amp;page=1\n\n\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b15e38f63d1f20d5058b8038d70d8f70f780eb0","amp;dn":"A+Hidden+America-Children+of+the+Mountains+2009+02+13+%2820%2F20%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b15e38f63d1f20d5058b8038d70d8f70f780eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,21,227,143,99,209,242,13,80,88,184,3,141,112,216,247,15,120,14,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
