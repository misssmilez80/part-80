Repetitive tasks can be accomplished using the built in scripting language or comprehensive batch conversion functionality. \t\t\n \t \t3D Path Profile\n\nHave you ever received a dataset that does not match the projection of your current project? Simply load the dataset into Global Mapper, change the projection, and save the file to match your coordinate system. If the dataset is larger than the area you are interested in, export the data using the crop feature and change the projection and format of the data at the same time.\t \t\n \t \tAerial\n\nYour data files can be loaded as layers, for example a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can be loaded with a scanned topographical map to create a 3D view of the map. A digital aerial image can be draped on the surface together with vector contour mapping to create a stunning and informative graphic. The results can be printed, or the workspace can be exported to a high resolution raster image for use in a presentation or report.\n\nGlobal Mapper supports viewing of dozens of the most common data formats:\n \nDLG-O\nDRG\nDOQ\nDEM\nDGN\nDTED\nDWG\tDXF\nSDTS DLG\nSDTS DEM\nECW\nMrSID\nESRI Shapefiles\nE00\tJPEG2000\nCADRG/CIB\nGeoTIFF\nKML/KMZ\nLidar LAS\nArc Grid\nTiger/Line\n\nAnd many, many more! Click to find out more about the formats supported by Global Mapper.\n\nProvides direct access to DigitalGlobe high resolution color imagery for the entire world from within the application!\n\nProvides direct access to the complete TerraServer-USA satellite imagery and topographic map archive for the entire US free-of-charge within the application!\n\nProvides easy, direct access to WMS data sources, including built-in access to the complete 30-m NED database, the 3-arc second world SRTM database, and color global imagery free-of-charge within the application!\n\nSupports true 3D viewing of loaded elevation data including draping of any loaded imagery and vector data over the 3D surface.\n\nCrop, reproject, and merge any combination of raster data and elevation data, including DRGs. You can also crop data to an area feature.\n\nDIGITIZING SUPPORT! You can digitize new vector (area, line, and point) features by drawing them with the mouse. You can also edit existing vector features. Newly created and editing features can be saved to any of the supported export formats. In addition, shapes like rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, and concentric range rings. can be easily drawn as well. You can also input features via a series of distance/bearing/COGO coordinates.\n\nGPS SUPPORT! You can track a compatible GPS device connected to your computer's serial port or USB port in real-time over any loaded data. In addition, you can mark waypoints at the current GPS location and record a tracklog of where your GPS device has been while connected, all seamless with your loaded map data! With supported devices you can even track multiple GPS devices in order to perform fleet management functions.\n\nPROJECTION/DATUM SUPPORT - Global Mapper supports accurate conversions between a large list of projection systems and datums. NAD27 datum conversions in the US use the NADCON conversion method, and the NTv2 datum conversion method is used for the NAD27 (Canada), AGD66, AGD84, and NZGD49 datums. Custom datum conversions can be easily added in either 3-parameter or 7-parameter form if a required datum transformation is not already supported.\n\nEXPORT SUPPORT! You can export both vector, raster, and elevation data to a variety of formats (see below). You can merge any combination of data sets, regardless of source scale, type, and projection. You can also breakup your data into a regularly spaced grid on export if you'd like as well.

You can graphically rectify (georeference) any JPG, TIFF, or PNG image and save the results to a new fully georeferenced image. Vector data can also have a rectification process applied to it after loading to allow morphing vector data to fit other data sets.\n\nCONTOUR GENERATION! You can create contours for any combination of elevation data. You can also specify the contour interval to use. The generated contour data can then be exported to any of the supported vector export formats (see previous item for a list).\n\nAutomatic triangulation and gridding of 3D point data sets, such as ASCII XYZ files. This allows you to convert a set of elevation samples into a fully gridded data set, which can then be used for contour generation, line of sight analysis, and view shed analysis, among other things. The data can also be exported to any of the supported elevation grid formats, such as USGS DEM.\n\nSupport for combining/comparing terrain surfaces, such as DEMs. This allows you to generate a new terrain surface by combining/comparing two loaded terrain surfaces with operations like subtraction (difference), averaging, and min/max. The results can then be exported to any of the supported elevation grid formats, such as USGS DEM.\n\nNASA World Wind Support! Any loaded data can be exported to JPG or PNG image tiles setup for immediate display in NASA's World Wind application.

This allows you to seamlessly view a collection of adjacent files.\n\nSupports opening SDTS DLG, SDTS DEM, and most other file types directly from .tar.gz and .zip archives. This saves the major headache of decompressing each SDTS transfer into a separate directory.\n\nComprehensive view shed analysis using loaded elevation grid data from a user-specified location, transmitter height, and radius.\n\n3D Path Profiling and Line of Sight (LOS) capabilities, including receiver/transmitter heights, minimum clearance, and earth curvature options.\n\nAdvanced measurement capabilities, including multi-segment path lengths and headings, enclosed area, and cut-and-fill volume calculations either along a path or within an enclosed area.\n\nAbility to link vector feature attributes to web sites or files.\n\nSupport the latest DEM and SDTS DEM formats, including decimeter DEMs.\n\nSupports opening DLG-O and DEM files directly from gzipped archives.
