In Jurassic Park, millionaire John Hammond asks two dinosaur experts to act as consultants on his entrepreneurial endeavour - an amusement park with DNA-cloned live dinosaurs as the main attraction. The palaeontologists, along with a mathematician and Hammond's two grandchildren, take a run-through tour of the park. The joyride soon turns to terror when an impending hurricane, an unscrupulous engineer and the rebelling dinosaurs begin to destroy the park. In The Lost Word - Jurassic Park, Dr. Ian Malcolm returns for more dino-horror, when he mounts another expedition to document the natural behaviour of the beasts. Venturing to the island where the dinosaurs were originally bred, the team faces adversity in the form of a less-than-scrupulous company executive and of course, the terrible lizards themselves. In Jurassic Park 3, Dr. Alan Grant is persuaded to take a flight over Isla Sorma by a wealthy businessman on a sightseeing mission, or so he thought. When the plane crashes into the island Paul Kirby reveals that he needs Grant's help to locate and rescue his fourteen year old son from the island. Can the party find the boy and escape before the genetically bred dinosaurs find them?
