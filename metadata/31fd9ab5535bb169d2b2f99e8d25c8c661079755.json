Then again, the music in the opening credits is &quot;to die for&quot;. We thought\nwe'd bring just these elements to you, in a maximum bitrate conversion using\nDivX author (altough it came up with only a 640 X 480 - lovely enough and easy\nfor many ipods to use too perhaps)and we gave it a whopping 192k audio bitrate.\nExcept of course we have a French audio channel alternative too in just one\nclip - the Restaurant scene&quot; and it was only monural at the source Im afraid so\nit came in at 128K given the music content in the background.\n\nAlong with the complete restaurant scene, the two most unforgettable (included\nhere) songs (scenes) I refer to are:\n&quot;gay Paree&quot;\n&quot;You and me&quot;\n\nAlso the theme music is included showing the opening credits clip.\n\nWith these clips, you are better able to select to view only what you would\nenjoy for the moment, much like the DVD and with similar video and audio\nquality, I might venture to add.\n\nSo who needs to download the DVD instead, huh?\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nPlease see my reviews at moviesbyrizzo.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31fd9ab5535bb169d2b2f99e8d25c8c661079755","amp;dn":"Victor+Victoria+DVD+clips+high+bitrate%2C+with+complete+great+song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31fd9ab5535bb169d2b2f99e8d25c8c661079755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,253,154,181,83,91,177,105,210,178,249,158,141,37,200,198,97,7,151,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
