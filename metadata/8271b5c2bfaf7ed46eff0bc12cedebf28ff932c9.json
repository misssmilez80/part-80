The only problem is the crew buying the drugs is     \n   renowned for being cowboys  but Tony has no choice. If he can get    \n       the money to Barry, he might be able to save Les.  Thanks         \n   to the beating he took, Steve is furious with Les. He also wonders    \n     if he and Darlene could get away clean, stealing the money from     \n    the exchange. Steve intimates that he's prepared to kill Tony to     \n    get the money  underneath is a simmering jealousy that's pricked    \n          whenever he sees Tony and Darlene together.  Barry             \n      sends Charlie to get the money  and when Tony fobs him off,       \n       Charlie reports back to Barry that there's a problem. Barry       \n     decides it's time to take control. Tony and Steve, with tension     \n     between them at an all time high, arrive to make the exchange.      \n     Barry and Charlie, wearing balaclavas and fully tooled up with      \n   automatic weapons, crash the party, killing two of the rival crew.    \n   Barry is furious with Tony, accusing him of treachery and ready to    \n      put him down. The remaining member of the rival crew grabs an      \n    automatic weapon and drops Steve. Police sirens are heard in the     \n   distance. Tony grabs Steve and they make their escape, momentarily    \n    avoiding Barry's wrath. Steve is dropped off at a hospital. Under    \n                  pressure, Darlene leaves town.  At                     \n     the pub, Barry, still amped with the buzz of the hijacking and      \n     despite a heartfelt plea from Tony, puts a price on Les's head.     \n   He's a dead man. And Mel and Charlie have a secret that will bring    \n                       the two families together.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                    &lt;a href=&quot;
