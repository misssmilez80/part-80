That their extensive project work, so far recorded on sixteen albums and one DVD, revolves around this intent goes without saying. The orchestra has over many years collaborated with well known composers and arrangers: Maria Schneider, Bob Mintzer, Kenny Wheeler, Avishai Cohen, Steve Swallow, Lew Soloff and Bengt- Arne Wallin to name but a few. For this album of Cole Porter material Landgren drafted in Colin Towns as arranger, paving the way for the band to present an exuberant, dynamic, almost burlesque yet still previously unheard and multilayered interpretation of twelve Porter hits.
