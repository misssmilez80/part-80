The song features The-Dream. The song leaked in March, and it was initially not supposed to be the lead single, but after the leak, Fabolous changed his mind because of the positive response he got from fans on Twitter.\n\nThe video for &quot;Throw it in the Bag&quot; released on May 28, 2009. It features model Claudia Jordan as a thief who is stealing from a department store. Talking about Claudia's character in the video, Fabolous says &quot;I'm kinda feelin' her. I'm feeling her integrity, I'm feeling her style, I'm feeling her going out and taking what she wants. By the end of the video, I'm kinda looking past her being this big thief, and maybe next time she throws things in the bag is because I'm buying it for her.&quot;\n\nLoso's Way is Fabolous' fifth studio album, to be released on July 28th, 2009.\n\nThe first two singles were released simultaneously, &quot;Throw It In the Bag&quot; features The-Dream and &quot;My Time&quot; features Jeremih.\n\nThis album is similar to Jay-Z's album, American Gangster, being that it is based on Carlito's Way. Fabolous planned on not having many guests on the album. The album was originally called Work Hard, Play Harder. The album was set to released on June 30, 2009, but it was pushed back to July 28 because Fabolous wanted to include the movie with the album.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75fdd49ecb2eab9c97eaf26d3d96f4fb80c06e60","amp;dn":"Fabolous+-+Throw+It+In+The+Bag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75fdd49ecb2eab9c97eaf26d3d96f4fb80c06e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,253,212,158,203,46,171,156,151,234,242,109,61,150,244,251,128,192,110,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
