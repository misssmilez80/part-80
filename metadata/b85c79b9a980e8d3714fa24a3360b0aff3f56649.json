After her stuffed rabbit opens a portal inside her dresser, Alice (Kristyna KohoutovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡) crosses over into a warped world of gothic props, puppets and dead animals. Svankmajer gives the Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat warped makeovers via stop-motion animation and stark cinematography. \n\n\n\nLength:\n91 minutes\n\nLanguage and Sound:\nEnglish\nOriginal Release Date:\n1988\n\nReally nice movie from jdpennington!
