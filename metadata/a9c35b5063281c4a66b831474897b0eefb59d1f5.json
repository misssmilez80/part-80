The purpose of Packet Tracer is to offer students and teachers a tool to learn the principles of networking as well as develop Cisco Technology specific skills.\n\nSystem requirements\n\n    * CPU: Intel Pentium 300 MHz or equivalent\n    * OS: Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Vista Home Basic, Vista Home Premium,  Fedora 7, or Ubuntu 7.10\n    * RAM: 96 MB\n    * Storage: 250 MB of free disk space\n    * Screen resolution: 800 x 600 or higher\n    * Macromedia Flash Player 6.0 or higher\n\nThe current version of Packet Tracer supports an array of simulated Application layer protocols, as well as basic routing with RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, to the extent required by the current CCNA curriculum. While Packet Tracer aims to provide a realistic simulation of functional networks, it should be noted that the application itself only utilizes a small number of features found within the actual hardware running a current Cisco IOS. Thus, Packet Tracer is unsuitable for modeling production networks, and at the time of this writing, unsuitable for any curriculum beyond CCNA.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c35b5063281c4a66b831474897b0eefb59d1f5","amp;dn":"Cisco+Packet+Tracer+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c35b5063281c4a66b831474897b0eefb59d1f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,195,91,80,99,40,28,74,102,184,49,71,72,151,176,238,251,89,209,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
