Now it seems\nthe right time to share it.\n\nA bootleg.  It's a compilation of some officially released remixes from MJ\nclassic tracks.  Sound quality is absolutely perfect.  No problem on that.\nThat Billie Jean (Down-And-Up Remix) has been a personal favourite for years.\n\nThis CD is also known as &quot;Polished Supergold&quot; and &quot;Twelve Mastermixes&quot;, and\nhas been semi-officially released in Malaysia.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6465da7da29ac7c4cf524395af8fee518a506e43","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Remixed+Supergold+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6465da7da29ac7c4cf524395af8fee518a506e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,101,218,125,162,154,199,196,207,82,67,149,175,143,238,81,138,80,110,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
