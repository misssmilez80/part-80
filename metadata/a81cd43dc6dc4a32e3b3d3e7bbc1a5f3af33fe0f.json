Chan takes on a rare dramatic role as a Chinese immigrant who becomes inexorably tied to the Japanese mob. No stranger to tough drama, Yee gives Shinjuku Incident an added relevance with his exploration of Chinese migrants fending for themselves in Tokyo's seedy Shinjuku district. Aiding Yee is an impressive Asian cast, starting with Chan and including Hong Kong's Daniel Wu (ProtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©), China's Fan Bing Bing (Lost in Beijing) and Xu Jing Lei (Warlords), and Japan's Takenaka Naoto (Shall We Dance?) and Kato Masaya (Brother). Before its successful spring theatrical run, Shinjuku Incident served as the opening film at the 33rd Hong Kong International Film Festival.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.yesasia.com/global/sh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.yesasia.com/global/sh&lt;/a&gt; ... -0-0-0-en/info.html\n\n\nSource...........: DVD9 Retail (HK)\n DVD Format.......: NTSC\n\nVideo Bitrate....: 8.28 Mb/s\n Screen Format....: Anamorphic Widescreen\n   1.78 : 1\n Audio Format.....:  DTS 6.1 , DD 6.1 \n\n Audio Language...: Cantonese, Mandarin , Japanese\n Subtitles........: English , Chinese\n Running Time.....: 119 min\n\n Cast.............: Jackie Chan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Daniel Wu ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bingbing Fan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kar Lok Chin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Naoto Katenaka\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81cd43dc6dc4a32e3b3d3e7bbc1a5f3af33fe0f","amp;dn":"Shinjuku+Incident+2009+UNCUT+DVD9-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81cd43dc6dc4a32e3b3d3e7bbc1a5f3af33fe0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,28,212,61,198,220,74,50,227,179,211,231,187,193,165,243,175,51,254,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
