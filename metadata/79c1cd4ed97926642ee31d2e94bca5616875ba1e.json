Australian Federation is one year old. 12 year-old\n        Tom's beloved father Nat has dragged him and his sister  Sarah\n        to an isolated farm at the  edge of the bush. But Nat's  dream\n        of living off the land has  died and he is losing his  grip on\n        sanity.  When  three  ex-soldiers arrive  at  their  cabin one\n        night, Tom, like his father, believes they are providence.\n\n        &quot;Your mother always said  never turn away strangers,  they may\n        be angels in disguise...&quot;\n\n        But  their presence  becomes more  menacing when  one of  them\n        reveals he has a secret: he's found gold. As the lure of  gold\n        infects everyone around him, the cabin becomes a psychological\n        battleground in  which Tom's  loyalty is  put to  the ultimate\n        test.\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n\n              Aden Young             ....
