Then, after arduous searching, we managed to gather the following lineup: \n\nHubert (Ulcer, ex Catelepsy, ex Interior) - vocal\nMaciek (ex Emptiness Cry) - guitar\nVegosh (ex Engraved) - bass\nPaul (Interior) - drums.\n\nGradually followed the work on material and looking for the second guitarist.\nIn May 2005 Gonthy (ex Twilight) joined the group. New more powerful and expressive pieces came into being, which drew inspiration from the fast, brutal and technical death metal from over the ocean.\nIn March 2006, already as a quintet, Soul Snatcher gave its first concert with Heresyer.\nIn June 2006 some personnel changes were made. Thus Maciek left and his place was occupied by Mike. In the year 2007 the group have given a few concerts on the local stage among others Metal Night (with such bands as Convent, Profundis, Odi Profanum Vulgus, Necrosadist).\nAt the turn of June and July we recorded the Promo CD, which contains four songs.
