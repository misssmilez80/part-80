The land the house sat upon, as well as the home itself, would vibrate inexplicably, Murphy explained. The area was neither by railroad tracks nor prone to earthquakes, he added. Murphy said the unexplainable vibrations eventually manifested into poltergeist activity, which he was able to record.\n\nMurphy described his experiences aboard the haunted Queen Mary, a place he said is filled with a palpable angst that many can feel. The strange sounds, mysterious 'sparkles,' and the fact that shadow people can be photographed there, provide strong evidence that something supernatural is taking place aboard the legendary ship, he said.\n\nMurphy discussed his research into the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. According to Murphy, visitors to the hotel, including himself, sense they are being touched our pushed by an unseen force. &quot;It felt like I had a bunch of vibrating phones in every pocket,&quot; he said. Murphy thinks discharge from crystals under the hotel may explain the phenomena.\n\nHe also touched on his 'Psychic Machines' presentation, in which explores the link between the human mind and the instrumentation of the operator.\nOpen Lines\n\nDuring Open Lines, Tom in Seattle revealed what may have been the real reason NASA's Moon program was cancelled after Apollo 17. Tom said a NASA contract officer told him that astronauts aboard the Lunar Orbiter saw lights from a giant moonbase while they were on the dark side of the moon. A voice speaking in English came on their radio and ordered them to &quot;explore no further,&quot; Tom added.\n\nGordon in Sacramento said he spent the evening with UFO researcher Ed Grimsley. Using night vision goggles, Gordon reported seeing a triangle formation of UFOs leave the atmosphere. Javier phoned in to share his story about having a 'voodoo curse' placed on him by a waitress at his work. He said the curse did not work. Javier also claimed to have hit a Grey alien over the head with a log.\n\nThe final half-hour of the show featured George's 10/24/07 interview with Uri Geller, who talked about his involvement in the new reality series Phenomenon.\nEarthquake Update\n\nAt the top of the show, geologist Jim Berkland provided updates on the earthquake that rocked China and mysterious tremors along the San Andreas that could be leading up to a large seismic event.\nWebsite(s):\n# ghosttown.tv\nVideo(s):\n# The Stanley Effect: A Piezoelectric Nightmare\n# The Queen Mary: A Floating Phenomenon\n# The WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Largest Ghost Town: A Post-Katrina Paranormal Investigation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406d34172b444a870d48fa056283cd4e8ee87d13","amp;dn":"Coast.to.Coast.AM.July.10.2009-komie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406d34172b444a870d48fa056283cd4e8ee87d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,109,52,23,43,68,74,135,13,72,250,5,98,131,205,78,142,232,125,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
