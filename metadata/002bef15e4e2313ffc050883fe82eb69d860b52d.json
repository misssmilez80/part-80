This is due to the physics of acoustic remote sensing, and to the varied geological processes at play. This book explains how to interpret sidescan sonar imagery and bathymetry. It shows the most recent advances, both in the technology and in the knowledge of marine structures, and provides a help to interpretation and decision-making.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002bef15e4e2313ffc050883fe82eb69d860b52d","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+of+Sidescan+Sonar+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002bef15e4e2313ffc050883fe82eb69d860b52d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,43,239,21,228,226,49,63,252,5,8,131,254,130,235,105,216,96,181,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
