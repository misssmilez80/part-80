Hard core thrash metal is artfully combined with creative melodics to form a fresh sound. Unlike some heavy metal where every song sounds the same, each song sounds fantastically different. A lot of hard work, talent and creativity went into this album and it shows. If you are looking for some fresh heavy metal than this album is definitly for you. Also, the lyrics are clean if that is concern for you. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc60544bbbc35abdbf94c87a9396be56e928e019","amp;dn":"Demon+Hunter-+Summer+of+darkness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc60544bbbc35abdbf94c87a9396be56e928e019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,96,84,75,187,195,90,189,191,148,200,122,147,150,190,86,233,40,224,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
