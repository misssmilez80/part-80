Far From Being A Tatty What-I-Did-In-My-Spare-Time Scrapbook Of Discards And B-Side Quality Cast-Offs, Lost Songs Offers Conclusive Proof That Even David Gray's Folk-Pop Wastepaper Basket Is Lined With Silver. Effortlessly Maintaining Gray's Brand-Image As A Troubadour-With-A-Troubled-Outlook, Via A Homogeneous Selection Of Achy And Predominantly Acoustic Heart-On-Sleeve Urban Spirituals, Many Of Lost Songs' Choicest Moments (&quot;Flame Turns Blue&quot;, &quot;As I'm Leaving&quot;, &quot;Falling Down The Mountainside&quot;) Could All Be Dylanesque Rungs From White Ladder. The Only Question Remaining Now Is How Much Higher Can He Climb?\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Flame Turns Blue\n[02] Twilight\n[03] Hold On\n[04] As I'm Leaving\n[05] If Your Love Is Real\n[06] Tidal Wave\n[07] Falling Down The Mountainside\n[08] January Rain\n[09] Red Moon\n[10] A Clean Pair Of Eyes\n[11] Wurlitzer\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 00h:36m:57s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 89.4mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320khps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Release\t\t- 17 April 2001\n\nRecord Company\t\t- ATO Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.davidgray.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/DavidGray \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/David+Gray \n\t\t\t-\n \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d097a166382104ba7bbf74d0ee4aca7b12443b7","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Lost+Songs+-+David+Gray+-+89mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d097a166382104ba7bbf74d0ee4aca7b12443b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,9,122,22,99,130,16,75,167,187,247,77,14,228,172,167,177,36,67,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
