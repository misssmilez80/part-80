VISUALIZE your message by turning it into a 3D TEXT! \n\nGo 3-Dimensional!\n 3D Text Commander turns any plain-text message into a captivating 3D text, letting you create your own 3D text logos, banners, messages and save it to your computer for use on your web pages, in documents and presentations. \nGive your 3D text a perfect look. You can choose from a variety of professional templates and add your own pictures and text. Choose a font (all system fonts can be used), colorize it, size it, add transparency.
