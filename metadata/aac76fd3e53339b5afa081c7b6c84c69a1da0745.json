Despite the efforts of the Marines and the SAS, the Ultranationalists seize control of Russia and declare Zakhaev a hero and martyr. Meanwhile, Vladimir Makarov, one of ZakhaevÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former lieutenants, begins a reign of terror against Europe by staging numerous terror attacks. The game begins in Afghanistan, where US Army Ranger Private Allen helps take a Afghan city from an army of militants. Impressed, General Shepherd recruits Allen as a CIA operative and places him in MakarovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organization as an undercover operative. However, Makarov is one step ahead. He kills Allen, exposes his identity as an American, and turns him into a scapegoat for a brutal terrorist attack on a Russian airport. Meanwhile, Soap and Roach infiltrate a Russian airbase to recover a lost ACS module.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac76fd3e53339b5afa081c7b6c84c69a1da0745","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+Modern+Warfare+2+PROPER-SKIDROW%28No+Rars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac76fd3e53339b5afa081c7b6c84c69a1da0745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,199,111,211,229,51,57,181,175,160,129,199,182,200,76,105,161,218,7,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
