Jackie plans a grand party at her posh home, so she wouldn't even invite 'lowlifes' Fez and Hyde, but Kelso not only falls to live up to her high society fantasies, as Donna expected, the simple gentleman invites his friends anyway- and thirty others, reasoning the more, the merrier, even Hyde and the popular school floozy Kat Paterson, who ignores her lover blatantly in 'cool' company. Donna encourages Eric to loosen up, but such company as Timmy who 'sets the mood' by dropping his trousers makes even him go overboard: Jackie's absurd classy teenager party dream turns nightmare, and the bitch blames poor Michael, whose attempt to break it up proves disastrous in itself... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 16: The First Time\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½14 February 2000\n\nDonna is happy when her parents announce they'll renew their wedding vows, although the whole ceremony is to be in loud Packers team colors, then disappointed their text suggestions aren't even vows, but ends up believing Eric: their love is true, it's up to her to phrase it appropriately; afterward it inspires here to take the next step with Eric... While Red grudgingly accepts to be best man, Kitty is so disappointed Midge didn't ask her as one of the three bridesmaids - she never was one- that when Leo, whom Hyde subcontracted as photographer, hits the sack with bridesmaid Holly, Kitty grabs her chance, and the green-gold dress. After the fire Kelso gets bitched at by both his lovers, but ends up proving his romantic value to Jackie. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 17: After Glow\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½21 February 2000\n\nEric is humiliated when Kelso blabs to the guys that Donna told Jackie that Eric was lame in the sack.

Neither admits it, but Jackie is jealous too, as Fez used to court her in vain and now pays her no attention, so she takes it out on Michael for not writing her poems like Fez does for Patty. Kitty wants to spend time with her baby boy, so Red, who realizes at that age no boy wants to be seen with his parents, tells her 'we pay his bills, we own him' and forces him, enthusiastically encouraged by eternal liar Hyde, to join her at a pizzeria, where crazy kid Timmy cries out aloud 'Eric is on a date with his mama', and a Woodie Allen Movie, torture because most scenes contain sex or drugs. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch:\n\nSeizoen 2 dvd 2\n\nThat '70s Show is de populaire retro show die gaat over het leven van een groep tieners in de Amerikaanse plaats Point Place.
