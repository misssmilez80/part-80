He is regarded by critics as one of the finest suspense novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. His 1951 debut, the pulp paperback novel Hill Girl, sold over a million copies. A dozen of his books have been adapted for the screen, most popularly Dead Calm.\n--Wikipedia\n\n  In Hell Hath No Fury by Charles Williams, a drifter named Madox wanders into a small town and finds work at a used car lot, but is just biding his time until he can devise the perfect bank robbery by setting diversion fires all over town. But someone's already set a fire for Madox: the used car lot owner's wife. In 1990, Hell was turned into a Dennis Hopper-directed movie called The Hot Spot starring Don Johnson (as Madox), and Virginia Madsen (as the boss's wife, Dolly Harshaw). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc796db80ef790a3a6362744cc9efd7f795caffa","amp;dn":"Charles+Williams+-+Hell+Hath+No+Fury+%28aka+The+Hot+Spot%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc796db80ef790a3a6362744cc9efd7f795caffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,121,109,184,14,247,144,163,166,54,39,68,204,158,253,127,121,92,175,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
