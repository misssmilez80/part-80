Narrated by Marty Robinson\n(the beggar) for same.  Found and transcoded\nvery old copy set from VHS Tapes bought out on E-bay &amp; stored for about 30 years.\nSo don't be too surprised if less-that-stellar quality--I did the best I could.  Last Episode,\nPrice of Gold, is missing about 6 minutes from the end.)  If anyone knows better place\nor better copies, love to add them to my collection, but couldn't let them go.  They are:\n\n1. Collision Course\n2. Rich High Desert\n3. The Great River\n4. Corridors of Time\n5. Land of the Sleeping Mountains\n6. Price of Gold.\n\nDivX format.
