The band released their self-titled debut album, Chickenfoot, on June 5, 2009. Regarding the band's status as a &quot;supergroup&quot;, vocalist Sammy Hagar states: &quot;WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not a supergroup, we like hanging out together and the music is a bonus. We just happen to be in other groups.&quot;\n\nWhile the band's name and logo reference a disparaging term used to describe the peace symbol, the &quot;footprint of the American chicken&quot;, bassist Michael Anthony asserts that the name originated from initial jam sessions between Hagar, Smith and himself: &quot;there are three talons on a chickenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foot and there [were] three of us.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe4fe04ab11d60d5cd4a639cd2f506237d6faf01","amp;dn":"Chickenfoot+-+Sexy+Little+Thing++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe4fe04ab11d60d5cd4a639cd2f506237d6faf01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,79,224,74,177,29,96,213,205,74,99,156,210,245,6,35,125,111,175,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
