The soldier scenes implanted to much social criticism and must have been based on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDawn of the DeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½they are us, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). These scenes changed the mood and slowed down the pace a lot. Still the second half is more a thriller than a horror movie, but the thrill is not broken by stupid conversations about ethics\n\nTime needed for the edition\nplanning: 2 weeks\nediting: 1 day\nsound editing: 1 day\ntrailer: 1 day\nDVD layout and features: 1 day\npersons involved: 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76afec140008207088eda44b0a3cad9d487146d","amp;dn":"27+Days+Later+%5Bfanedit.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b76afec140008207088eda44b0a3cad9d487146d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,106,254,193,64,0,130,7,8,142,218,68,176,163,202,217,212,135,20,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
