From the day BLiZZARD was formed in february   \n  1998 we have always been on the very top of the release rankings and  \n  unlike many other groups we have almost never had any periods of      \n  idleness or relaxation.                                               \n  Over the years many friends joined us and we have grown to become      \n  one of the biggest groups on the scene. New sections were created     \n  (mp3/iso/pda) and all of them have been a great enrichment            \n  for all of us, however unity and friendship have always remained,     \n  even during times of upheaval and depression. All parts of BLiZZARD   \n  work together with great enthusiasm and harmony. The spirit of a big  \n  family has never vanished and has always given us a very unique       \n  character.                                                            \n  Although we have always appreciated being one of the most active      \n  release groups our primary concern has never been to rule the scene   \n  but to spend a very nice time of our lives along with many good       \n  friends. Friendship and fun will always be our most valuable          \n  principles and according to them we will act. Over the years we have  \n  neither been involved in any groupflames nor have we offended other   \n  scene people without reason. Unlike many other groups we do not       \n  believe in silly and childish flames, we treat our competitors        \n  equal, however we want to give special props to the many old-school   \n  groups which are still active and have survived all the recent busts  \n  and problems.                                                         \n  Furthermore BLiZZARD has always offered its members a unique          \n  atmosphere plus many benefits when it comes to release conditions.    \n  We have shown the scene that you can be on the top without putting    \n  your members under pressure, we simply believe in equality and        \n  friendship. And, of course, many friendships, which go far beyond the \n  simple cracking business, have been formed. Every BLiZZARD member     \n  will tell you what a great feeling and honour it is to be a part of   \n  our family. It is such a great and motivating feeling to play a part  \n  in it.                                                                \n  For the future we have already set many targets and we will reach     \n  them for sure, expect many suprises from us.                          \n  BLiZZARD will never die, see you soon at the 12000th release :)       \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                                                              \n                    \n                   greetings                   \n                                                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n  greets fly out to all groups which actively and courageously work on \n      building better release conditions and thus keep the scene up.   \n                  special greets to our friends in:                    \n        acme - arctic - backlash - class - equinox - lnd - oddity      \n                     orion - tfa - toads - siechtum                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n                    \n                       retired                    \n                                                                \n                                                                       \n    we wish them the best in real life and thank them for all their     \n    great work they have done for blizzard.. we'll never forget you!!   \n    our fallen heroes: xxxxxx - xxxx - xxxxxxxxx - xxxxxxxxx - xxxx     \n                        xxxxxxxxxx - XxxxxxxX - Xxxxxx                  \n                                                                         \n                                                                     \n                                                                \n                    \n                      ?joinin?                 \n                                                             \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n                                                                        \n     We are a closed group, if we need you then we will contact you!    \n                                                                        \n        Software worth using is worth buying.. keep this in mind!        \n                                                                        \n                                             last update on: 2002.09.25 \n                           .               .                           \n                                                                  \n                                                                 \n                      this .nfo drawn                 \n            by jered^blz!    \n                                             \n                         .                   .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c3ec69f9c44e506fce38a60490035b8d0e9119b","amp;dn":"PerpetualBudget.System.v6.0.7.WinALL.Regged-BLiZZARD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c3ec69f9c44e506fce38a60490035b8d0e9119b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,62,198,159,156,68,229,6,252,227,138,96,73,0,53,184,208,233,17,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
