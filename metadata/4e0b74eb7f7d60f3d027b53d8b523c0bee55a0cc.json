She writes her own songs and plays the guitar, piano and more. I love her voice. She reminds me of Ingrid Michaelson in style. I have permission from the artist to try to spread her music like wildfire by all means. Expect a bonux album with extra songs soon! Enjoy!\n\nUploaded by\n--CTDragon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e0b74eb7f7d60f3d027b53d8b523c0bee55a0cc","amp;dn":"Mollys+Untitled+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e0b74eb7f7d60f3d027b53d8b523c0bee55a0cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,11,116,235,127,125,96,243,208,39,181,61,139,82,60,11,238,85,160,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
