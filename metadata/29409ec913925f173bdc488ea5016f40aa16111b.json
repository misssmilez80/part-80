These days bass is boring, all bass lines just playing along with the guitar not even sounding good, Mudvayne the only band in the nu-metal genre that is complicating their bass lines which gives their songs a raw edge. Blunt Object incorporate some slap bass in their songs which does go along with the guitar but makes it sound uncomplicated but interesting Mudvayne bass line. Vocally they sound a lot like Machine Head with the melodic vocals and deep screams, they variate their sound of the vocals a lot which is good. Another band out of Australia which we'll see get more recognition.\n\ntrax- \n\nChance Or Reason\t\n\nThis Fear\t\n\nSilver Lining\t\n\nIn This World\n\t\nDomino Effect\n\t\nDeal With It\n\t\nTorment Ridicule\t\n\nDeadman\t\n\nWords Of Wisdom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29409ec913925f173bdc488ea5016f40aa16111b","amp;dn":"Blunt+Object+-+Edgeless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29409ec913925f173bdc488ea5016f40aa16111b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,64,158,201,19,146,95,23,59,220,72,142,165,1,111,64,170,22,17,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
