TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re carved from the same stone as Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan and the Allman Brothers. Subtle as a punch in the face, their musicianship is without question; guitar solos run amok as drums fly at you in all directions, while Parker Griggs bemoans about womanly woes and many other of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s common ills. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not original in the least, but sure as hell sounds good. These boys from Iowa know what they are doing, and Brain Cycles is sure to cause all but the most jaded blues rock fan to drop his head in awe and cry out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgoddamnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at least once. This isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Wolfmother-style emulation of a classic rock sound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this is the real deal.\n\nWhile Radio Moscow doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t venture off the beaten path on Brain Cycles, the Iowa bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second album, the material within is performed much more confidently this time around.\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to guess itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because guitarist/vocalist/mastermind Parker Griggs assembled a band and took his show out on the road after Radio Moscow was released. Brain Cycles is a little looser, a little more fluid, and a little more in tune with how to wring the most out of tried n true blues rock riffs. Compare Brain CyclesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lead track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t KnowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the debutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIntroductionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½/ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Frustrating Sound.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sure, the latterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s instrumental opener spells out GriggsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ proficiency on guitar, but the easy-going groove of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrustrating SoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shifts the album back to second gear. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ however, leaps right out of the gate and sets the tone for the entire album. More importantly, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more than just a conduit for some admittedly tasteful solos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an honest-to-goodness song.\nAnother good example of how Radio Moscow has upped the ante is with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo Good Woman.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a kindred spirit to the self-titledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLucky Dutch,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ except that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is way more energetic and has enough subtle shifts to make the song really jump. That the rhythm sectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pushed higher up in the mix helps as well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it gives the album a more urgent, dynamic feel and brings the recorded material closer to the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s live intensity.\nMake no mistake, Brain Cycles is more than a continuation of Radio Moscow; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an overall improvement.
