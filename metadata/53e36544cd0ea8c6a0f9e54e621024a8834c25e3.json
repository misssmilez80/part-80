Like the other two, this was a lot of fun to put together, though the trip to Sandia Lab still haunts me a bitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give that away. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just have to see. I actually havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen the final cut since we put it together late last year, so to be honest when I watch it tomorrow itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be a bit like seeing it again for the first time.\nSpeaking of which, my daughter will be in school when it airs, so I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t watch it until we can see it as a family. That means I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be live-tweeting or anything like that.\nAnd to answer the inevitable question: I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if the network is picking it up as a series or not. I expect the ratings of the airing tomorrow may play into that, so tell a friend! Or tell a few dozen.\nI hope you like it, and have at least as much fun watching it as I did making it.\nApril 18th, 2011 7:00 AM Tags: coronal mass ejection, radiation, solar flare, supernovae\nby Phil Plait in Bad Universe, TV/Movies ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e36544cd0ea8c6a0f9e54e621024a8834c25e3","amp;dn":"Bad+Universe+Death+stars+x264+AC3+5.1+%5BDD%5D+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e36544cd0ea8c6a0f9e54e621024a8834c25e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,227,101,68,205,14,168,198,160,249,229,78,98,16,36,168,131,76,37,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
