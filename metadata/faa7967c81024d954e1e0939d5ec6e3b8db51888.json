C O M IS ALIVE NOW. DESCRIPTION FIXED!\n\nSoundtrack for old quest game Toonstruck. \nThis is unique release, because all included files were taken from various production music libraries as within an original game, but ingame ones included low-resolution library files with 22 kHz mono channel music, while mine are 48 kHz / 16 bit / stereo FLACs. Of course you can convert them in any lossy format you want.\n\nAs production music libraries lawyers can pull my head off, i've forced all contents into KGB 2 (http://kgbarchiver.net/?page=download) archive. Big sorry for this, and be patient waiting while contents extracting, it may should take even few hours on old machines. This was made to not allow auto-indexing torrent monitors like mininova, btmon and similar to show contents of this release.\n\nArchive contains metadata info about tracks (from which libraries they were taken from and who performed them, html file (http://home.arcor.de/lebostein/toonstruck.html) with association which track is identified to which file in game and finally tracks itselves. Only right identified tunes are included.\n\nDon't forget about production music libraries policy, and understand that all rights on this music materials are belong to libraries itselves, not the musicians by hire or historical musicians.\nIf you ever watched Nickelodeon or &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; cartoon show you maybe heared some of these tunes.\nAlso you should understand that most part of included tunes are historically rare and source of their record is unkown, most of them weren't published on commercial sources (like audio compact disks), so it's useless to try using AudioChecker software on them.\nThe only one way is to download Ren and Stimpy Production Music torrent (http://www.d e m o n o i d . c o m/files/details/1962020/1539508/) which offers 256kbps and 320kbps MP3 files and compare them in Tau Analyzer with mine.\nComments with acoustic graphs or other researchs are welcome. Also recognition of still unkown tunes are welcome. Part of them were taken from old revisions of production music disks and now replaced with different versions in modern P.M. libraries.\n\nCurrent tracklist (44 tracks, numbered by recognition):\n01 - Richard Harvey - The War Machine\n02 - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake Suite Theme 1 - Danses Des Cynges\n02 - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake Suite Theme 2 - Danses Des Cynges\n03 - Sam Fonteyn - Little Symphony - Spooky Scherzo\n05 - Brian Laurence Bennett - In Danger\n06 - W.
