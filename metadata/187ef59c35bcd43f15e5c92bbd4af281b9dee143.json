Her essential tremor is         \n         particularly visible in this one (she was well over 80       \n         when it was recorded), but she still gives a performance     \n         worthy of praise, and makes the most of a sweet little       \n         script. Interesting to note is that one of her co-stars,     \n         the teenage daughter of the Gomphers family, is her real     \n         life great-niece Schuyler Grant, most well known for         \n         her role as Diana Barry in the Anne of Green Gables TV       \n         movie series.                                                \n                                                                      \n           CRNVCD already did this one years ago, but as we came      \n         to discover, their release used joint stereo audio for       \n         what is a mono soundtrack. It was also tagged STV, even      \n         though this is a TV movie. Our release corrects these        \n         flaws, and also cleans up the video a bit compared to        \n         theirs - this wasn't a particularly good transfer.           \n                                                                      \n                     Enjoy!                                           \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                          \n                                \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187ef59c35bcd43f15e5c92bbd4af281b9dee143","amp;dn":"Laura.Lansing.Slept.Here.1988.TV.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187ef59c35bcd43f15e5c92bbd4af281b9dee143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,126,245,156,53,188,212,63,21,229,201,43,189,74,242,129,185,222,225,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
