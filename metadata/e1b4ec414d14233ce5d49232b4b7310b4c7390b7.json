Also, FYI, collecting these albums was a huge task, and so some of the preset volumes might not be consistent, especially if you are using off-brand media players.\n\nI hope you strangers get some enjoyment out of this band that I have loved and admired intensely for the past decade. And don't forget to seed and leave comments!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b4ec414d14233ce5d49232b4b7310b4c7390b7","amp;dn":"Cardiacs+-+Full+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b4ec414d14233ce5d49232b4b7310b4c7390b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,180,236,65,77,20,35,60,229,212,146,50,180,183,49,11,76,115,144,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
