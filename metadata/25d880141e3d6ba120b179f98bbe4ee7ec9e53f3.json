Just fail. Thus the name.\n\nCompletely vulgar, totally racist, crude, full of plot holes... what can you expect from filmmakers during their downtime.\n\nIt's fail... but strangely it works.\n\nI have another &quot;Season&quot; I'm going to upload pretty soon as well.\n----------------------------\nRunning time: 55 minutes too long\n\n\n\nCheck us out at Wolfenfilms.com.
