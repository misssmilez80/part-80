As a dominion of the Empire the newly acquired territory was renamed Area 11. The rights of its citizens were severely limited and an economic depression followed for the Japanese, now known as Elevens. Just as things seemed at their bleakest one man chose to stand up and fi ght, the masked crusader Zero. Leading his Order of Black Knights, Zero instigated a full scale revolution against Britannia culminating in one fi nal battle, the Black Rebellion. Heavy casualties were seen by both sides but ultimately Britannia stood the victor resulting in ZeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s execution. And thus was history written. The year is now 2018. With Zero dead and the remnants of the Black Knights being swept up by the Britannian forces, a forced state of peace settles over Area 11.\n\nThe rights of the Elevens remain limited but with no one to lead them and the defeat during the Black Rebellion hanging over them, the Japanese people remain under the boot of Britannian oppression with no hope to overcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af370a27c8d92df017e731e83da3889d2e8826b","amp;dn":"%5BZ-Z%5D+Code+Geass+R2+1-7+Region+1+DVDRip+%28Dual+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af370a27c8d92df017e731e83da3889d2e8826b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,243,112,162,124,141,146,223,1,126,115,30,131,218,56,137,210,232,130,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
