Set between Episode III and Episode IV, it focuses on the fledgling struggle between the Empire and the Rebels. It uses Petroglyph's game engine Alamo. The most recent patch was released on July 20, 2006. In October 2006, an expansion entitled Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption was released.\n\nThere are three game modes: storyline-based Campaign, Galactic Conquest and Skirmish. Battles can take place on a planet (land battle) or above the planet (space battle). Land battles are fought with infantry and ground vehicle units, while space battles are fought with starfighter squadrons and large spacecraft.\n\nGalactic Conquest is the sandbox campaign, in which the player controls the Rebel Alliance as it struggles to achieve freedom or command the Empire and strive to achieve galactic domination. A weaker, neutral faction of Pirates exists, but makes no attempt to battle the Rebels or Empire unless attacked. Each faction has at least one of three broad objectives for Galactic Conquest, which vary depending on which scenario is being played: kill the enemy leader (Mon Mothma or Emperor Palpatine), protect or destroy the Death Star, or completely remove the other faction from the campaign map. Grand strategy, production, and resource management is facilitated through a two-dimensional galactic map. The player receives funds from planets they control and from mining facilities. Money is used to research technology, build defenses and vehicles, and train troops. Each planet confers different advantages to its owner, even though some bonuses are specific to each faction (for example, controlling Kuat reduces the price of Imperial Star Destroyers by 25 percent).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a4a43015b6c5a06aa9c6152122904d0d4e9a1d","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Empire+At+War+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a4a43015b6c5a06aa9c6152122904d0d4e9a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,164,164,48,21,182,197,160,106,169,198,21,33,34,144,77,13,78,154,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
