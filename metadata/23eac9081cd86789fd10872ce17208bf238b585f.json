Charles is married, has a worn out marriage with his wife Deanna Schine (Melissa George) and they have been saving money for years for their diabetic daughter that needs a transplantation of kidney associated to a new expensive experimental drug.  \n\nA couple of days later, Charles invites Lucinda for lunch, then for some drinks and finally they begin an affair and decide to go to a cheap hotel. The room is invaded by a thief, Laroche (Vincent Cassel), who robs the couple and rapes Lucinda. A few days later, Charles is blackmailed, but Lucinda is reluctant to go to the police since she does not want to lose the custody of her daughter.
