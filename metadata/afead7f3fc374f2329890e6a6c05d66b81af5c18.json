Includes new Mike Phillips remake of the classic hit, &quot;Street Life&quot; also featuring Jill Scott! The album also includes hits by Donald Byrd, Nancy Wilson(one of the best versions ever of ode to billie joe), Labi Siffre and Bobbi Humphrey! Pop-Jazz is jazz music that lives in the present. It's a movement that captures the freshly original, creative and innovative musicians who claim a broader musical turf than traditional jazz, yet have the distinctive playing style and compositional voice that doesn't exist in the smooth jazz camp. These musicians have conceived a sophisticated yet accessible art form that matches the artistry of traditional jazz but also incorporates a more eclectic musical appetite that deftly fuses the influences of hip hop, soul, funk, rock and pop experiences. \n\n\n\n    \n1.
