Nothing is more important than that you feel good! And you have absolute and utter control about that because you can choose the thought that makes you worry or the thought that makes you happy; the things that thrill you, or the things that worry you. You have the choice in every moment. --- Abraham\n\n&quot;The Teachings of Abraham&quot; is the original source material for the current Law of Attraction wave that is sweeping the world, and it is the 21st century inspiration for thousands of books, films, essays and lectures that are responsible for the current paradigm shift in consciousness. \n\nHere you will find accurate clarification of the basics of the Law of Attraction and practical applications as well as up-to-the-moment leading-edge expanding information regarding the Law of Attraction. (Also known as &quot;The Teachings of Abraham&quot;)\n\nThis is the fountainhead of the information upon which the hit movie, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe SecretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was based.\n\nEsther and Jerry Hicks\nIn 1985, Jerry and Esther Hicks began dialogs with Abraham, a name chosen by a group of nonphysical teachers, who deliver an inspirational message of joy and well-being. Jerry and Esther travel to over forty cities every year, offering workshops where participants direct their questions to Abraham and learn ways to achieve all that is desired in life.  \n\nAbraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Non-physical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self. \n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, which illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5537606ec6b2f7cfd819a71573371141733ada27","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+2007-10-27+Asheville%2C+NC+4CDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5537606ec6b2f7cfd819a71573371141733ada27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,55,96,110,198,178,247,207,216,25,167,21,115,55,17,65,115,58,218,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
