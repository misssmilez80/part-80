Burn In Hell\n02. Lord Satan\n03. Temple Of Metal\n\nThis 3-song EP is a rather coveted FWOSHM (First Wave Of Swedish Heavy Metal) item and bears the &quot;In The UK&quot; title because the band upped sticks and recorded this EP in England to try and get the full on NWOBHM vibe, and also to be taken more seriously by the International Metal community.\nIt also had the unfortunate effect of fooling record collectors that they were a NWOBHM band, you still see it turn up on Brit Metal &quot;wants&quot; lists.\nThey were at least semi-successful in their musical aims, opener &quot;Burn In Hell&quot; offering up a strong JUDAS PRIEST style feel.\nThe opening bars to &quot;Lord Satan&quot; are simply astounding, Heavy Metal thunder, before returning to a more basic riffing structure. \nThe closing &quot;Temple Of Metal&quot; with it's bleak SAXON-esque leads is probably the best track on this release, being less derivative than the others.\nSo, &quot;In The UK&quot; is certainly not the most overrated of all FWOSHM EPs, you get 3 diverse full on Metal/HR songs for your cash.\nJust don't pay too much!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e607789be67275f31351695df8e5caee7137f31","amp;dn":"AIRBORNE+-+In+United+Kingdom+EP+%28SWE-1983%29+-+80s+Geophagus+serie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e607789be67275f31351695df8e5caee7137f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,96,119,137,190,103,39,95,49,53,22,149,223,142,92,174,231,19,127,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
