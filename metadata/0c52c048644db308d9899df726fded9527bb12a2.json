I've never really been a big fan of John Mayer but he blew me away with this performance.  In my opinion it was the best performance from the entire memorial.  If you have yet to hear this then I definitely suggest you give it a listen here \n\n\nRIP MJ!!!  Still can't believe he's gone.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c52c048644db308d9899df726fded9527bb12a2","amp;dn":"John+Mayer+-+Human+Nature+%28From+Michael+Jackson+Memorial+7%2F7%2F09%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c52c048644db308d9899df726fded9527bb12a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,82,192,72,100,77,179,8,217,137,157,247,38,253,237,149,39,187,18,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
