Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always good at effectively removing it. The majority of Anti-Malware Scanners are well able to detect malicious software - Trojan Horses, Internet Worms, Adware/Spyware etc. - but are not always efficient in removing them once they have been triggered.\n\nTrojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to manually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system modifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by some standard antivirus scanners. Trojan Remover scans ALL the files loaded at boot time for Adware, Spyware, Remote Access Trojans, Internet Worms and other malware. Two types are available.\nThe Standard scan quickly scans the system with no need for further configuration of the scan parameters.The Custom scanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ allows the user to select any of the folders for scan.\n\n\nAre you bombarded with popup ads, seeing new toolbars in your browser, is your home page changing to unwanted destinations or are you bombarded with irritating spam?

This Utility will reset the Home/Start/Search pages to standard Defaults. You can then manually reset your Home Page to your website of choice (or leave it &quot;blank&quot;, the default).\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Reset HOSTS file\nThe Windows HOSTS file is a text file which stores website addresses. The file can be used to speed up access to websites you visit often - by equating the website name (e.g. microsoft.com) with its DNS address, the web browser can find the website more quickly as it does not have to query a DNS Name Server. Some Malware programs add entries to this file, to either deny access to websites (usually security-related or antivirus company websites), or to re-direct access to websites of their choosing.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Reset Windows Update Policies\nSome Malware programs attempt to prevent Windows Update from running, and inhibit access to resetting Windows Update by blanking out the Windows Update options on the Update configuration screen. This Utility will check the current Windows Update settings and correct them where necessary.\n\nHome Page - http://www.loaris.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d37e9f26a2094ce8aaa07455880c8b115aa0bce4","amp;dn":"Loaris+Trojan+Remover+1.2.3.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d37e9f26a2094ce8aaa07455880c8b115aa0bce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,126,159,38,162,9,76,232,170,160,116,85,136,12,139,17,90,160,188,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
