In 1774 Georgiana achieved immediate celebrity by marrying William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire, one of EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s richest and most influential aristocrats. She became the queen of fashionable society and founder of the most important political salon of her time. But GeorgianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s public success concealed an unhappy marriage, a gambling addiction, drinking, drug-taking, and rampant love affairs with the leading politicians of the day. With penetrating insight, Amanda Foreman reveals a fascinating woman whose struggle against her own weaknesses, whose great beauty and flamboyance, and whose determination to play a part in the affairs of the world make her a vibrant, astonishingly contemporary figure. \n\nPlease seed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3986b6631accef056aea9a45b0a0b44f4c3e69d","amp;dn":"The+Duchess+-+Amanda+Foreman++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3986b6631accef056aea9a45b0a0b44f4c3e69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,152,107,102,49,172,206,240,86,174,169,164,91,10,11,68,244,195,230,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
