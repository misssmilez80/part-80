It is the 14th and last of the series, due to the recent and untimely death of Professor Lions. \n\nThe texts in this volume deal mostly with various aspects of the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. They present both theoretical and applied results in many fields of growing importance such as Calculus of variations and optimal control, optimization, system theory and control, operations research, fluids and continuum mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, meteorology and climate, homogenization and material science, numerical analysis and scientific computations \n\nThe book is of interest to everyone from postgraduate, who wishes to follow the most recent progress in these fields.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf437fabc00773be3b4369cefdf7a0c7e250deb","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1997%5D+Nonlinear+Partial+Differential+Equations+and+Their+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf437fabc00773be3b4369cefdf7a0c7e250deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,244,55,250,188,0,119,59,227,180,54,156,239,223,122,12,126,37,13,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
