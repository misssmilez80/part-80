When you are browsing through dozens of \n visually similar folders, you are not using your vision to its full extent \n and thus your activity is less effective than it could be. But if some of  \n these folders have a different color, they will catch the eye faster than  \n you read their name. This way you can easily differentiate between folders \n and browse much faster, because you are using your vision much more        \n efficiently.                                                               \n                                                                            \n Enjoy another fine release from HERiTAGE!                                  \n\n INSTALL NOTES:                                                             \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              \n Unpack, Install.                                                           \n Apply the patch in the installation dir.                                   \n Make sure to close all your explorer windows before applying the patch!    \n                                                                            \n                                       HERiTAGE / HERiTAGE 2009             \n\n    \n\n\n\n    [ HERiTAGE MEMBERS ]\n\n  [HTG] REMEMBERING THE PAST AND FULFILLING OUR GOALS IN THE PRESENT [HTG]  \n\n        ALL HERiTAGE MEMBERS WERE TAKEN OUT DUE TO SECURITY REASONS!        \n                OFFiCiAL HERiTAGE MEMBERS KNOW WHO THEY ARE ;)              \n\n    \n\n\n\n    [ HERiTAGE SiTES ]\n\n     SYSTEM NAME        SYSTEM OPERATOR   NODES  SPEED      POSiTiON    \n\n                                                                            \n  REMOVED FOR SECURiTY REASONS...
