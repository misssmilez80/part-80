Unlike other installer\n        builders that require week-long training courses in order to get\n         up to speed, Setup Factory was designed to be fast and easy to\n          use. By pairing a visual layout of your software's files and\n          folders with a point-and-click interface, the entire process\n              becomes completely logical and absolutely painless.\n\n           What's more, Setup Factory creates a compact, single-file\n         setup.exe that runs on any version of Windows from 95 to Vista\n        (and above) and is perfect for distribution by Web download, CD \n                             -ROM, DVD-ROM and LAN.\n                                    \n                  Use the following serial number when asked:\n                            SUF-XCRT-F26E-LKYU-HBND\n\n                                          \n                   NFO LAST UPDATED           \n                       06-11-2004              \n                         -----                  \n                 &lt;LNK/CPS&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:252a82b78c0216aad7ebc66f9037fd0b90e635d5","amp;dn":"IndigoRose.Setup.Factory.v8.2.1.retail-FOSI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"252a82b78c0216aad7ebc66f9037fd0b90e635d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,42,130,183,140,2,22,170,215,235,198,111,144,55,253,11,144,230,53,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
