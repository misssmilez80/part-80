I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNOTES: Some goofball at Mercury played commercials too long again coming back from the first commercial break each hour.  I put the scratch in to indicate, as usual.\n\nAlso, this may be my last upload for 2 weeks.  I definitely will be out of country for a couple of weeks, but will try to cap and edit the web broadcast.  Again, I do this for myself so I can listen at my convenience.  If I am able to do this while out, I will upload.  Just FYI...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03009421fc5616fe40c6f597a0d23d9e55340471","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-04-25+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03009421fc5616fe40c6f597a0d23d9e55340471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,0,148,33,252,86,22,254,64,198,245,151,160,210,61,158,85,52,4,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
