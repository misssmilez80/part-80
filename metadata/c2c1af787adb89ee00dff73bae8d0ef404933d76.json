His alternative magazine, Post Modern Review, pokes fun at the media obsessed stars and bucks trends, and so when Young is offered a job at the diametrically opposed conservative New York based Sharps magazine its something of a shock! It seems Sharps editor Clayton Harding is amused by Young's disruption of a post-BAFTA party with a pig posing as Babe. Thus begins Sidney's descent into success - his gradual move from derided outsider to confidante of starlet Sophie Maes. Initially helping him out at Sharps is colleague Alison Olsen, who has her own secret. Wither their friendship?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c1af787adb89ee00dff73bae8d0ef404933d76","amp;dn":"How+to+Lose+Friends+and+Alienate+People.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c1af787adb89ee00dff73bae8d0ef404933d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,193,175,120,122,219,137,238,0,223,247,59,174,141,14,244,4,147,61,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
