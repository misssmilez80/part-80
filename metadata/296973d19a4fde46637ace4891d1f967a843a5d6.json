The rest of the gang turn their backs on him thinking he's sold them out. Like most of the others, this film suffers from a somewhat stale story but there are plenty of laughs with the best being the one where the gang poison's one of the crooks. The last fifteen minutes turn to drama and the actors handle this very well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:296973d19a4fde46637ace4891d1f967a843a5d6","amp;dn":"Smart+Alecks+%281942%29+.+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"296973d19a4fde46637ace4891d1f967a843a5d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,105,115,209,154,79,222,70,99,122,206,72,145,209,249,103,168,67,165,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
