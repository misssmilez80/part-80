The first two seasons are in .avi format and the third season is 720p and in .mkv. Quality went down when I converted it so .mkv is what you get...if you want .avi convert it yourselves.\n\nDexter is an American television drama series that airs on the premium channel Showtime. Set in Miami, the series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a covert serial killer governed by a strict moral code who works for the Miami Metro Police Department as a blood spatter analyst.\n\nThe show is based on characters created by Jeff Lindsay for his series of Dexter novels. It was adapted for television by Emmy Award-winning screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the pilot episode.\n\nOn October 21, 2008, Showtime renewed the series for a fourth and fifth season, each consisting of 12 episodes. Production began in early 2009, with season four premiering September 27, 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04b4f58dd5f6208d3d2379d39f6d211ae235b415","amp;dn":"Dexter+Seasons+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04b4f58dd5f6208d3d2379d39f6d211ae235b415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,180,245,141,213,246,32,141,61,35,121,211,159,109,33,26,226,53,180,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
