This includes both major label releases, Dragline and Death To Traitors as well as Death To Traitors sessions, the independently released Home Is A Strange Place, Live At The Bottleneck - 2004, and a rare EP of covers and oddities Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself.\n\nI did not create this torrent, merely downloaded and reproduced it to keep it alive as there are rarely any seeds.  I apologize as it is ripped at 128 Kbps, but it is better than not having it.  I saw a retail copy of Home Is A Strange Place listed for over $120 on-line, and this is free.  Complain all you want, just seed!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPaw Discography\n\nDragline - 1993\nDeath To Traitors - 1995\nThe &quot;Death To Traitors&quot; Session Tapes - 1995?\nKeep The Last Bullet For Yourself - 1998\nHome Is A Strange Place - 2000\nLive At The Bottleneck - 2004\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dabf833397d05104d87faa85d169ab360dda65c6","amp;dn":"Paw+-+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dabf833397d05104d87faa85d169ab360dda65c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,191,131,51,151,208,81,4,216,127,170,133,209,105,171,54,13,218,101,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
