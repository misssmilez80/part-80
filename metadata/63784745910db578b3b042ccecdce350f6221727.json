A group of Crusaders arrive; one of them introduces himself as Balian's father, Baron Godfrey of Ibelin. Godfrey asks Balian to return with him to Jerusalem. Balian refuses and the Crusaders leave. The town priest, Balian's half-brother, reveals that he ordered Balian's wife beheaded before burial, a customary practice for people who commit suicide. Balian notices his brother wearing the cross that his wife wore before she was to be buried. In a fit of rage Balian kills his brother, retrieves the crucifix and flees the village. Balian pursues his father in the hope of gaining forgiveness and redemption for him and his wife in Jerusalem. After he reaches Godfrey, soldiers led by Godfrey's nephew arrive, ostensibly to arrest Balian. In reality, the nephew intends to assassinate Balian and Godfrey so that his father, and eventually he, may inherit Godfrey's barony. Godfrey refuses to surrender Balian. The nephew launches a sneak attack against Godfrey. The attack fails and Godfrey kills his nephew, but is struck by an arrow that breaks off in his body. In Messina, Godfrey knights Balian and orders him to serve the King of Jerusalem and protect the helpless, before succumbing to his injuries. During Balian's journey to Jerusalem his ship runs aground in a storm, leaving Balian and a horse as the only survivors. When Balian releases the horse from the wreckage it flees in panic. Following the horse, Balian is confronted by a Muslim cavalier and his servant. A fight over the horse follows and Balian reluctantly slays the cavalier when attacked, but spares the servant, asking him to guide him to Jerusalem. Upon arriving, Balian gives the horse to the servant and releases him. The man tells him his slain master was an important knight amongst the Saracens; his deed will gain him fame and respect from them.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | History\n\nRelease date: 6 May 2005 (UK)\n\nCAST\n\nOrlando Bloom\nEva Green\nJeremy Irons\nDavid Thewlis\nBrendan Gleeson\nMarton Csokas\nLiam Neeson\nEdward Norton\nGhassan Massoud\nKhaled El Nabawy\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Kingdom of Heaven DC 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 3058.35 MiB\nDuration: 3h 9mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 256 Kbps\nSubtitles: Albanian,English,French,Dutch,Spanish,Greek,Netherlands\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-05-20 17:15:48\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1924 08d04a4\nAverage video bitrate: \nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/17193294427062642517.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/17193294427062642517.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/57793427119841865637.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/57793427119841865637.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/86321494171458219224.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/86321494171458219224.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/25848941756168454464.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/25848941756168454464.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/32313276541972883818.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/32313276541972883818.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24268053405828163648.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24268053405828163648.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/44671312422899849114.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/44671312422899849114.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63784745910db578b3b042ccecdce350f6221727","amp;dn":"Kingdom+of+Heaven+DC+720p+BRRip+Multi-Sub+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63784745910db578b3b042ccecdce350f6221727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,120,71,69,145,13,181,120,179,176,66,204,236,220,227,80,246,34,23,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
