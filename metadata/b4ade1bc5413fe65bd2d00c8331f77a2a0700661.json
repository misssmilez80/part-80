The style was reggae-ska-rock-ish and changed more into a rock band through the years. This is for everyone who wanted to listen to those albums as they are all nearly sold out.\n\nContents of Torrent:\n\nPudding Fields Discography\n\n1998 - Pudding Fields\nThese are the first demo songs of the band with the first singer - Simon Pribac. Even if these songs weren't on any official CD, they are well known to hardcore fans even today. These songs were supposed to be the first package of 6 songs to be on the first cd but the second package was never recorded.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Spider\n02 - Proleter\n03 - Vsak dan\n04 - Pedofil\n05 - Kanela Bar\n\n2002 - Xavier demos\nThese are the second demo songs which feature the new singer of the band - Maksim Vergan for the first time and are - as in the first demos - part of what is should be - the first CD that would come out. It didn't. Some are early versions of official songs that would be recorded in the near future, some are old songs rerecorded for quality purposes and vocal changes.\n\nTracklist: \n01 - NajveÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ja Prevara 21. Stoletja\n02 - Zvezdnik\n03 - TV Ekran (je glavni car)\n04 - Proleter\n05 - Big Joe\n06 - Kanela Bar\n\n2003 - NajveÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ja Prevara 21. Stoletja\nFinally the first official album surfaces. Recorded at studio Rose Nova Gorica, also by sleeping in the studio the band manages to get things done properly this time. It felt victory as you could finally not just listen, but touch your music.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Raketa\n02 - Moj NajlepÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡i Dan\n03 - Zvezdnik\n04 - Cirkus\n05 - Vrtovi\n06 - Vrtiljak\n07 - Obeseden\n08 - TV Ekran (je glavni car)\n09 - THC-uden\n10 - Popotnik (kdo si?)\n\n2005 - Sodni Dan\nThe second album gets done and you can hear the difference as the band progresses and gains experience not just by playing live but also gains effectiveness during recording sessions. More &quot;rocky&quot; as the first album and definitely more enjoyable.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Kupid\n02 - Belo\n03 - Srebrna Krogla\n04 - Halo Zemlja\n05 - Oz\n06 - Dan Potem\n07 - NajlepÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡e Sanje\n08 - Edina Moja\n09 - Vesolj-ska\n10 - Sodni Dan\n11 - Belo Horizonte\n\n2005 - Remixes\nThere are 2 remixes of the song Belo. One featured a compilation of dance remixes Called DJ Time 11.  They were never part of official albums.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Belo RmX\n02 - Belo RmX DJ Time\n\n2007 - SreÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ni Izbranci\nThe third album is definitely rocky and ska/reggae is hard to hear in this piece of art. But this does not mean that this is a bad cd. The band evolves through the years and gets as they say &quot;back to the rocky roots&quot; and keeps on rocking from its mystical intro to the end in hard riffs and fast rocking melodies\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Intro (Vzlet)\n02 - Feniksov Let\n03 - SreÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½a\n04 - Heroj\n05 - Moj Svet\n06 - Metulj\n07 - Norec\n08 - Vrtovi 02\n09 - Monster\n10 - Kralj\n11 - Radio\n12 - Kocke (SreÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ni Izbranci)\n\n2009 - Stockholmski Sindrom\nThe last official album (for now) finally says goodbye to trumpet and saxophone and concentrates on hard rock riffs and strings. This is the best Pudding Fields album, still not overproduced. Easy to sing and to remember, these tunes won't get out of your head.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Stockholmski Sindrom\n02 - Vsaka NoÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½\n03 - Danes Ni Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â e Ãƒâ€žÃ…â€™as Za Smrt\n04 - Tunel\n05 - Zadnje Sekunde\n06 - Mistika\n07 - Nasmeh\n08 - Hotel\n09 - Supermen\n10 - Led\n11 - Stockholmski Sindrom (AC)\n\nFor more on Pudding Fields check Facebook!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ade1bc5413fe65bd2d00c8331f77a2a0700661","amp;dn":"Pudding+Fields+Discography+%5B128-256kbps%5D+%40+VolumeToTheMax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ade1bc5413fe65bd2d00c8331f77a2a0700661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,173,225,188,84,19,254,101,189,45,0,200,51,31,119,162,160,112,6,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
