The six episodes comprising the latter half of the show's first season were not aired and the show was subsequently canceled. In the summer of 2008, the unreleased episodes were finally broadcast on the Seven Network in Australia.\n\nBe forewarned that since these are TVRips, there is a channel logo overlay on all of the videos. Until these episodes are broadcast again or released on DVD, neither of which may ever happen, these are probably the best quality rips you'll be able to find.\n\nI am only responsible for creating the torrent and take no credit for these rips. The pilot and first six episodes of Cavemen are easy to find, but as far as I know the last six episodes have not been publicly available on BitTorrent until now.\n\n\nEpisodes\n--------------------\nS01E07 - &quot;Nick Jerk, Andy Work&quot;\nS01E08 - &quot;Nick Sick&quot;\nS01E09 - &quot;Caveman Holiday&quot;\nS01E10 - &quot;Andy the Stand-Up&quot;\nS01E11 - &quot;Cave Kid&quot;\nS01E12 - &quot;Hunters &amp; Gatherers&quot;\n\nMedia Info\n--------------------\nVideo Format: AVI\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1030kbps\nResolution: 624x352\nFrame Rate: 25 fps\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kbps\nAudio Sample Rate: 48kHz\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: N/A\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:750de3ce9c5d607ae50f8e338e36c256977349de","amp;dn":"Cavemen.S01E07-12.PDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"750de3ce9c5d607ae50f8e338e36c256977349de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,13,227,206,156,93,96,122,229,15,142,51,142,54,194,86,151,115,73,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
