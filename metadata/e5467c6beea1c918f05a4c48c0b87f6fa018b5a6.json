Max walks and finally stumbles upon the only nearby human outpost in the wasteland that remainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the seedy community of Bartertown, founded and nominally run by the ruthless Aunty Entity (Tina Turner).\n\nIn Bartertown, electricity, vehicles, functioning technologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all almost unheard of in this post-apocalyptic worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are made possible by a crude methane refinery, fueled by pig faeces, using a weathered semi tractor as the electricity generator. The refinery is located under Bartertown and is operated by the smart, diminutive Master (Angelo Rossitto), who is harnessed to his enormously strong, but dim-witted bodyguard known as Blaster (Paul Larsson). Together, &quot;Master Blaster&quot; hold an uneasy power-truce with Entity for control of Bartertown; however, Master is beginning to exploit his position with energy &quot;embargoes,&quot; challenging Auntie's leadership. She is furious with him but cannot challenge him publicly, as Master is the only one with the technical know-how to operate the machinery that powers Bartertown. The controlled chaos of Bartertown is maintained by a set of inflexible laws, including one that states that no deal can be broken, for any reason. The punishment for breaking this law is equally inflexible and invoked with the simple phrase, &quot;bust a deal, face the wheel.&quot;\n\nEntity recognizes Max as a resourceful (if disposable) fighter, and strikes a deal with him to provoke a duel with and kill Blaster in the &quot;Thunderdome,&quot; a gladiatorial-esque arena where conflicts are resolved, turning what is arguably a political assassination into a lawful act. Max goes to the Underworld, where he befriends a convict who was imprisoned for killing a pig in order to feed his children, and thus nicknamed Pig Killer (Robert Grubb). The rules of matches in the Thunderdome, as chanted by onlookers crowding the arena, are simple and singularÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;two men enter, one man leaves.&quot; After a stunningly long and difficult match, Max defeats Blaster, but refuses to kill him when he discovers that Blaster is a man with the mind of a young child. An enraged Auntie has Blaster executed and invokes their single law since Max broke his deal with her. The wheel, which serves as a judge and jury, turns out to be a large, spinning metal disc (similar to a Wheel of Fortune) with an arrow pointing to one of several consequences. Possible consequences include Death, Hard Labour, Acquittal, Gulag, Aunty's Choice, Spin Again, Forfeit Goods, Underworld, Amputation, and Life Imprisonment. When spun for Max, it lands on &quot;Gulag.&quot; He is cast out of Bartertown and exiled to the desert wastes.\n\n\nPLEASE...SEED...AND...ENJOY...THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5467c6beea1c918f05a4c48c0b87f6fa018b5a6","amp;dn":"MAD-MAX-3-Beyond.the.Thunderdome.DVDrip%28vice%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5467c6beea1c918f05a4c48c0b87f6fa018b5a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,70,124,107,238,161,201,24,240,90,76,72,192,184,127,111,160,24,181,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
