It has stood the test of time and not only contains some of the best singles from the 90s, but is a modern-day classic. The songs are incredibly infectious and danceable, but it's undeniably a rock album, with crunching guitars, intense drumming and a charismatic frontwoman. In an era of post-grunge Garbage's brand of rock/pop/retro offered a refreshing change of pace, and cynical lyrics for cynical times.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 27\nArtist: Garbage\nAlbum: Garbage\nYear: 1995\nGenre: Alternative\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a5bf9f9360c22fcc800bdfe96db33054e5160c","amp;dn":"Garbage+-+Garbage+%5BFLAC-1995%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a5bf9f9360c22fcc800bdfe96db33054e5160c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,165,191,159,147,96,194,47,204,128,11,223,233,109,179,48,84,229,22,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
