I used the dvd transfer from &quot;bowenjaybee&quot; Why because the movie itself was a dissapoinment, not filmed and edited very good.\n\nI upgraded the boring intro, uused partly black and white, shortend it and made new titles. \nAlso I grouped the songs by band. So I think you better enjoy the concert.Put titles with band names and with each song.  New fans will enjoy it much easier. \nI replaced the boring ballet dancing parts of Madness's Swan Lake with other footage, from teh movie. It's tighter and faster. The outro is also upgraded, also using partly black and white.\n\nI have never had seen the film before, only heard of it, I was 12 then, living in the Netherlands, but if I had seen my version in the cinemas I would have enjoyed it.\n\nBowenjaybee, thank you for the dvd-transfer and the first cuts.\n\nWell I hope you also will enjoy\n\nNew playlist:\n\nThe Specials - Nite Klub (Intro)\nThe Beat - Ranking Full Stop\nThe Beat - Big Shot\nThe Beat - Rough Rider\nThe Beat - Twist &amp; Crawl\nThe Beat - Mirror In The Bathroom\nThe Bodysnatchers - 007(Shanty Town)\nThe Bodysnatchers - Easy Life\nThe Bodysnatchers - Let's Do Rock Steady\nBad Manners - Ne Ne Na Na Na Na Nu Nu\nBad Manners - Wooley Bully\nBad Manners - Inner London Violence\nBad Manners - Lip Up Fatty\nMadness - The Prince\nMadness - Swan Lake\nMadness - Razor Blade Alley\nMadness - Madness\nMadness - Night Boat To Cairo\nMadness - One Step Beyond\nThe Selecter - Three Minute Hero\nThe Selecter - Missing Words\nThe Selecter - Too Much Pressure\nThe Selecter - On My Radio\nThe Specials - Concrete Jungle\nThe Specials - Too Much Too Young\nThe Specials - Man At C&amp;A\nThe Specials - Nite Klub (Outro/Reprise)\n\nPlease be patient and please seed when you have a complete copy\t\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e4854f3cc13daf6e7e31076df60462d4e74fa1f","amp;dn":"DANCE+CRAZE+Best+Of+Britsh+Ska+re-edited+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e4854f3cc13daf6e7e31076df60462d4e74fa1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,72,84,243,204,19,218,246,231,227,16,118,223,96,70,45,78,116,250,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
