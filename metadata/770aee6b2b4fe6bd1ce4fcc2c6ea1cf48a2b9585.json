Hersh reveals that despite using Iranian informants and cutting edge surveillance technology, U.S. officials have been unable to find decisive evidence that Iran has been moving enriched uranium to an underground weapon-making center.\n\n\n- Seymour Hersh on the Arab Spring, &quot;Disaster&quot; U.S. Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the Looming Crisis in Iraq\n  \nVeteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh assesses the popular uprisings sweeping the Middle East and North Africa amidst ongoing U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Despite touted gains and an upcoming U.S. military withdrawal deadline in Iraq, Hersh says: &quot;Whatever you're hearing, Iraq is going bad ... It's sectarian war, and the big question will be whether we pull out or not.&quot; On the uprisings, Hersh says Saudi Arabia-fearing an overthrow of the regional order-is driving the embattled regimes' attempts to crush the protests.\n\n\n- WikiLeaks Cables Reveal &quot;Secret History&quot; of U.S. Bullying in Haiti at Oil Companies' Behest\n\nThe Nation magazine, in partnership with the Haitian weekly newspaper, HaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ti LibertÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, has launched a series of reports based on more than 19,000 classified U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Called &quot;The PetroCaribe Files,&quot; the series begins with an exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of how the United States-with pressure from Exxon and Chevron-tried to interfere with an oil agreement between Haiti and Venezuela that would save Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, $100 million per year. &quot;It is really amazing to see an ambassador pushing around a president, and all his officials telling them what to do, trying to tell them what Haiti's interests are. It is the epitome of arrogance,&quot; says the report's co-author, Kim Ives. We are also joined by veteran Haiti correspondent, Dan Coughlin.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:770aee6b2b4fe6bd1ce4fcc2c6ea1cf48a2b9585","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+03+jun+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"770aee6b2b4fe6bd1ce4fcc2c6ea1cf48a2b9585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,10,238,107,43,79,230,189,28,228,252,194,198,234,28,244,138,43,149,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
