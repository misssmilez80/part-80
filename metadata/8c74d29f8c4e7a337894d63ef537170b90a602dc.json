To find out, he goes back to basics and sets up his own food \n       factory in a barn.\n       \n       Jimmy uncovers the tricks and techniques that food producers use to \n       ensure we can enjoy favourite foods whenever we want. In the barn, \n       Jimmy makes a first attempt at turning some of his own farmed pork \n       into square sandwich ham. He also tries to copy the trick that \n       banana suppliers use to artificially ripen green imported bananas so \n       they are ready for the supermarket.\n       \n       Jimmy copies the square ham factory production processes using 100 \n       hypodermic needles, a bicycle pump, a cement mixer, a tin bath and a \n       length of square drainpipe. He completes his investigation into \n       science trickery by discovering how fish farmers fool their fish into \n       believing it's summer when it's winter, so that farmed salmon is \n       available all year round. He also uncovers the trick farmers use to \n       produce mushrooms out of season.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n          \n                                                 \n                  GROUP INFORMATION                    \n            9 Years of the Force and still           \n                        going strong                          \n           \n             \n           What we are looking for:\n \n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC.\n           * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n           * Fios cappers in u.s\n           * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n           * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage   \n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc \n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95d3fae7f6f0d5fde0e6fdbbf4fc&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c74d29f8c4e7a337894d63ef537170b90a602dc","amp;dn":"Jimmys.Food.Factory.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c74d29f8c4e7a337894d63ef537170b90a602dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,116,210,159,140,78,122,51,120,148,214,62,245,55,23,11,144,166,2,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
