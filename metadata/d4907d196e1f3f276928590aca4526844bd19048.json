What if literature itself generated our ideas and feelings about justice, marriage and family, property, authority, race, or gender? What if it enflamed our determination to pursue justiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or, conversely, undermined our ability to detect injustice?\n\nWhat if law in all its variationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from religious commandments to oral tradition to codified statuteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½embraced its own narrative assumptions to the point of absorbing purely literary conventions as a means of more forcefully arguing its points in the legal arena?\n\nAnd what if this dynamic relationship between written and unwritten laws and literature is constantly evolving? How do law and literature influence or reflect one other? And what lessons might we draw from their symbiotic relationship?\n\nRepresenting Justice: Stories of Law and Literature is a provocative exploration of just such questionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an examination of the rhetorical and philosophical connections that link these two disciplines.\n\nMine the Riches of a New Scholarly Field\n\nProfessor Susan Sage Heinzelman, who has been honored many times for her teaching skills, is also president of the Association for the Study of Law, Culture, and the Humanities, and she brings to these lectures many years of thought and research into the roles of law and literature in society and culture and their relationship to one another.\n\nShe is especially concerned to break down the stereotypical definitions of these two disciplines: that literature is fictive and subjective, that is, persuasive on a primarily emotional level understood as the realm of the feminine, and that law is factual and objective, and thus primarily persuasive in the intellectual realm traditionally ascribed to the masculine.\n\nProfessor Heinzelman refers to the representation of culture, whether legal or literary, through language, image, symbol systems, and action. It is the intertwining of the stereotypical definitions that she untangles in these lectures, showing how each has contributed to creating our cultural beliefs and expectations &quot;in similar waysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by offering us ways of imagining ourselvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½both at our best and at our worst.&quot;\n\nProfessor Heinzelman's examination encompasses more than 3,000 years. It begins with the Old TestamentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in which literature was lawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and takes us through ancient Greece, the Middle Ages, England's experience of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and the 19th and 20th centuries. Focusing on works of literature that hold law, implicit or explicit, as a central themeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as on the overall relationship between law and literature in societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½she shows how that relationship gradually transformed from the astoundingly intricate cross-connections between law and literature still present during the time of Shakespeare, to a point in the mid-18th century when the two disciplines separated more clearly into the distinct realms we recognize today.\n\nFresh Insights into Great Works and Their Eras\n\nAs Professor Heinzelman guides you through these great works, she shows how each reflects its times, and she offers fresh insights that can illuminate even those with which you may already be familiar. For example:\n\n     ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In The Scarlet Letter , you'll see how a woman sentenced to a lifetime of community shame sets aside societal dictates to create a new standard of virtue for women.\n     ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the 1917 short story, A Jury of Her Peers, you'll see how a reporter covering a sensational turn-of-the-century murder trial would one day reconfigure the events of the case into a play and a short story that would dramatize the implications of all-male juries sitting in judgment on female defendants.\n     ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  And in Lolita, you'll see how a single literary work can challenge not only a society's written jurisprudence, but its unwritten moral codes, as well.\n\nAs presented by Professor Heinzelman, these and the other works explored in this course each present their own challenges, forcing you to re-evaluate the ways you read fiction, watch films and plays, or take in legal arguments. Indeed, you may never do any of these things the same way again.\n\nAbout Your Professor\n\nSusan Sage Heinzelman, Ph.D., is associate professor of English and Women's and Gender Studies at The University of Texas at Austin, where she has taught in both the English Department and the School of Law since receiving her doctorate from the University of Western Ontario in 1977.
