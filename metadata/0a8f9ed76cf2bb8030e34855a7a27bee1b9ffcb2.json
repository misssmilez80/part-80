This criminal is     \n    hiding out, disguised in a crowd of innocent people. Don't let him    \n    get away, and don't hit the innocent! Your mission is simple, find    \n    your target in a crowd, scroll around with your finger. Then zoom     \n    in and shoot! (Keep in mind that there is a distance delay from       \n    when you shoot and hit your target.) If you miss, your reward will    \n    decrease. And if you hit an innocent person, you will be penalized.   \n    As the levels progress, the difficulty increases, the crowds get      \n    thicker, bigger, faster and there are more obstacles.
