Lost for days, wandering farther and farther astray, Trisha has only her portable radio for comfort. A huge fan of Tom Gordon, a Boston Red Sox relief pitcher, she listens to baseball games and fantasizes that her hero will save her. Nature isn't her only adversary, though - something dangerous may be tracking Trisha through the dark woods. \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5590a2771b79512493084d5d88486734e6e8657","amp;dn":"Girl+Who+Loved+Tom+Gordon%2C+The+-+Stephen+King-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5590a2771b79512493084d5d88486734e6e8657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,89,10,39,113,183,149,18,73,48,132,213,216,132,134,115,78,110,134,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
