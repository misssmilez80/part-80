But now Picard is confronted with orders that undermine that decree and must rebel against Starfleet to lead the insurrection to preserve Paradise.\n\nNemesis:\n\nCaptain Jean-Luc Picard and the Enterprise-E crew find themselves on a diplomatic mission to initiate peace with the Romulans. Learning that the Romulans have undergone a political upheaval and their new Praetor, Shinzon, wants to discuss a peace treaty with the Federation, Picard and his crew must investigate the situation and determine Shinzon's sincerity. But they learn that not only is the new Praetor not a Romulan at all but a native of Romulus' sister planet Remus, they also find that he is a human replica of Picard, originally bio-engineered by the Romulans to be substituted for the captain as a weapon against the Federation. Now, Picard and his crew must determine if the Romulans truly desire a peace treaty, or if they have other plans in mind","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a4af429604c95dbf5a6719b728b016e13d1fbe","amp;dn":"STAR+TREK-NEXT+GENERATION+BOXSET-+DISC+3%264+OF+4+IN+H.264+BY+WINK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a4af429604c95dbf5a6719b728b016e13d1fbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,164,175,66,150,4,201,93,191,90,103,25,183,40,176,22,225,61,31,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
