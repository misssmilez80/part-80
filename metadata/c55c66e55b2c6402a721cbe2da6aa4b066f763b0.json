They formed in 1985.\n\nThe Bloody Hawaiians\n-The Threegos (1994)\n\nThe Extra Glenns are a band made up of Franklin Bruno of Nothing Painted Blue and John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats. They were something of an underground legend in the 90's, recording tracks for singles and some compilations. Both artists however started concentrating on their own solo work, though as their popularity grew they continued to work together when possible. A show at the 2000 San Francisco Noise Pop Festival found an unexpected crowd in attendance with exceeding interest with fans coming from as far away as New York just for the Extra Glenns. They decided then that it was a good idea to keep it going and in 2002 Absolutely Kosher Records released Martial Arts Weekend, the group's first full length album. John has recently stated in interviews that The Extra Glenns are working on a new record under a new moniker.\n\nThe Extra Glenns\n-Martial Arts Weekend (2002)\n\nThe Mountain Goats is a Durham, North Carolina-based band led by American singer-songwriter John Darnielle. Darnielle began recording in 1991, and is known for his highly literate lyrics and (until 2002) his lo-fi recording style. The Mountain Goats' albums have featured a constantly changing line-up of musicians, with Darnielle the only constant; when performing live, the band commonly comprises only Darnielle backed by Peter Hughes on bass guitar.\n\nThe Mountain Goats\n-All Hail West Texas\n-Beautiful Rat Sunset\n-Come, Come To The Sunset Tree\n-The Coroner's Gambit\n-Full Force Galesburg\n-Get Lonely\n-Nothing For Juice\n-Sweden\n-Tallahassee\n-We Shall All Be Healed\n\nThe Mountain Goats &amp; John Vanderslice\n-Moon Colony Bloodbath [EP] (2009)\n\nThe Mountain Goats &amp; Kaki King\n-Black Pear Tree [EP] (2008)\n\nAesop Rock\n-None Shall Pass (2007)\n--&quot;Coffee&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55c66e55b2c6402a721cbe2da6aa4b066f763b0","amp;dn":"John+Darnielle+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c55c66e55b2c6402a721cbe2da6aa4b066f763b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,92,102,229,91,44,100,2,167,33,203,226,218,106,164,176,102,247,99,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
