Now \n\nthe longest he has been contracted is 2 months. But now billionaire, James Rethrick offers \n\nhim a job that would last 2 years, maybe 3, and he promises that he will probably earn 8 \n\nfigures. Michael agrees. Before beginning he turns in all of his personal effects. And when \n\nthe job is done, his memory is erased and he learns he made over 90 million dollars over the \n\nthree years. When he goes to claim it and his personal effects, he discovers that prior to \n\nthe erasure of his memory he waived his rights to the money he earned and that the items \n\nthat were given to him were not the ones he gave when he began. Later he is arrested by the \n\nFBI who say that he committed some act of treason and murder. It's while he is in custody \n\nthat he escapes using some the items that he was given. He later meets with a friend who \n\ngives him some information that helps him understand what is going on. And at the same time \n\nRethrick for some reason wants him so he is being pursued by Rethrick's people\n\nCast:\n\n\n\nBen Affleck\t ... \tJennings\n\nAaron Eckhart\t... \tRethrick\n\nUma Thurman\t... \tRachel\n\nPaul Giamatti\t... \tShorty\n\nColm Feore\t... \tWolfe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d84f56bf5cd539820000e6bb6a95d79439b1c736","amp;dn":"Paycheck%5B2003%5D%5BENG%5DDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d84f56bf5cd539820000e6bb6a95d79439b1c736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,79,86,191,92,213,57,130,0,0,230,187,106,149,215,148,57,177,199,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
