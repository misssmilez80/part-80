They have known each other since their days at the music academy and developed a very strong friendship. They met Lana there and Jack had an affair with her then. This friendship deteriorated along the years and Lana left Jack for Henry. Jack's \nresentment towards Henry will increase even further when he realizes that although his talent as a pianist is as great a talent as Henry's, he always ended up second... behind Henry. Simultaneously, Lana slowly realized that the only thing Henry cares about is his job. \n\nWhen she gets pregnant, he tells her he doesn't want the child and she leaves him, taking refuge with Jack who thus finds a way to get back at Henry.
