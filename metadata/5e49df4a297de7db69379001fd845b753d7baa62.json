Protesters were not only students, but men and women of all ages from all walks of life. They faced tear gas, clubs, and bullets.\n\nReports say that the Basij, the religious militia which has terrorized the people of Iran, were outnumbered on the streets today. They clashed with the protesters. Sometimes, they broke and ran.\n\nThe people of Iran are fighting against dictatorship. They will continue to fight. With the support of the world, they will win.\n\nThis torrent contains 61 videos, mostly from the protesters themselves. We see the Basij throwing rocks at people. We see the police unleashing tear gas. We see protesters march bravely through smoke and tear gas in every major street of Tehran and beyond.\n\nWe see supporters of the demonstrators in Britain and the Netherlands rallying against the regime.\n\nBut mostly, we hear the chants of tens of thousands of people with one voice: Marg bar diktator -- down with the dictator! \n\nIf you want to help, join us at http://iran.whyweprotest.net/\n\nThe master list of Anonymous's Iran videos is located at http://gonzotimes.net/?page_id=500\n\n:ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¯ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¨Ãƒâ€ºÃ…â€™ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§ÃƒËœÃ‚Âª ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¨Ãƒâ€ºÃ…â€™    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4973942/Persian_revolutionary_literature_______________&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4973942/Persian_revolutionary_literature_______________&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRead this if you want to help or get help!\n\nHelpers:\n\n\nA.
