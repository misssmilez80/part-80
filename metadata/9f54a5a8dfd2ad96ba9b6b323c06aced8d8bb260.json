Baltik played energetic jazz-rock dominated by Schaffer's eminent guitar lines and Lindh's flute, sax and fender piano. These two later played in Ablution.\n\nThis somewhat gloomy, progressive album, comprising cream of the crop of the era's Nordic session scene, plus one bass virtuoso from England, John Gustafson (Roxy Music, Quatermass, Ian Gillan Band, Hard Stuff) is now one of the ultimate collectors items for most Deep Purple, Atomic Rooster and Roxy Music afficionados. It starts off quite heavy, then the pace is slowed down with a gospel-flavoured ballad a-la early Elton and maybe Joan Armatrading (who lead singer Beverly Glenn certainly sounds like), which sets the mood for the rest of side A. Side B is filled with quirky, interesting but somewhat murky prog rock, which takes a little bit of getting used to - especially if it doesn't grab you from the first listen; give it another chance.\n\nAlex Gitlin\nOctober 2000\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f54a5a8dfd2ad96ba9b6b323c06aced8d8bb260","amp;dn":"Baltik+-+Baltik+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f54a5a8dfd2ad96ba9b6b323c06aced8d8bb260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,84,165,168,223,210,173,150,186,155,107,50,60,6,172,237,141,139,178,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
