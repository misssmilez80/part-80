One\n                morning in 1860, the inhabitants of a sleepy\n                Wiltshire village wake up to a shocking discovery.\n                Behind the shuttered windows of the Kent family's\n                elegant country house, a horrific murder has taken\n                place. As the local police struggle to find the\n                culprit, the case becomes a national scandal, and\n                Inspector Jack Whicher of the newly formed Scotland\n                Yard detective department is sent to the countryside\n                to solve the crime. When he arrives, Whicher soon\n                realises that the Kent investigation will be the most\n                challenging of his career. As he tries to crack the\n                case, he must deal with the prejudice of the press\n                and the public, as well as an inept local police\n                force.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c25992b0dd1443219e7a55d3d96e953d16f152","amp;dn":"The.Suspicions.Of.Mr.Whicher.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c25992b0dd1443219e7a55d3d96e953d16f152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,194,89,146,176,221,20,67,33,158,122,85,211,217,110,149,61,22,241,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
