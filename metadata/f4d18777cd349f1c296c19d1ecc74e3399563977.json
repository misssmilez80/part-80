Everything is digitized and offered to employees and clients via inter and intranet. Long gone is the age of restricting access to filing cabinets of paper manuals, client information, and confidential company memos. Securing information from people it is not intended is imperative. It is we who catch these companies who do not take the necessary steps to protect their clients and networks from prying eyes. We catch them with their pants down, and expose their unwillingness to protect for all to see. Make note: None of this information was obtained using illegal means. No passwords were cracked. No backdoors were used.  All of this information was and still is at the time of this release, available to be viewed using a standard web browser and some skills interpreting URL's.  Much of it is basic internal information such as schematics, with little value to all but a very few interested parties. Some, could be seriously damaging and compromising if allowed into the wrong hands. \n\nWhy would we release such information, then? Because it is not our job to protect you from yourself or others. We choose who we do business with carefully. We use caution when we release our personal information on the internet. We trust that the firms we deal with do the same. This release is to prove that these firms do not, and leave much to be desired in the field of security.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d18777cd349f1c296c19d1ecc74e3399563977","amp;dn":"Private%2C+Exposed+Notes+on+Internets+and+other+Syndicates+-PENIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d18777cd349f1c296c19d1ecc74e3399563977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,209,135,119,205,52,159,28,41,108,25,209,236,199,78,51,153,86,57,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
