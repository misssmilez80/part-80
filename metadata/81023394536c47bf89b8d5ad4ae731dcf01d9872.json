As Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy and the rest of the characters meet for the first time, Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban and the Ministry of Magic responds by sending Delores Umbridge to the school to watch out for Harry, and Remus Lupin also comes to Hogwarts to take up the job of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Its story is mostly from books 1, 3, and 5. (from TV Tropes http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVeryPotterMusical)\n\nThere is another version of this musical available on TPB, however, it is in 30 parts. So, I combined all the files into Act 1 and Act 2, making it much easier to view. \n\n\nThis is my first torrent. I hope you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81023394536c47bf89b8d5ad4ae731dcf01d9872","amp;dn":"A+Very+Potter+Sequel+by+Team+Starkid+in+2+Acts+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81023394536c47bf89b8d5ad4ae731dcf01d9872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,2,51,148,83,108,71,191,137,184,213,173,74,231,49,220,240,29,152,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
