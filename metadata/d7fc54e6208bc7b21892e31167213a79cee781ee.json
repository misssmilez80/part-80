The album was released on March 24, 2009.\n\nJustin Furstenfeld unveiled the title and tentative track listing on Blue October's website on January 31, 2008. Pre-production of the album began at the beginning of 2008 with demos being recorded at 5am Studio in Austin, Texas and in Sony Recording Studios in Tokyo, Japan. The recording sessions for the album began on August 18, 2008, and were completed on October 24, 2008, with the band recording the album at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Studios near Austin with Grammy Award-winning producer Steve Lillywhite. Post-production was completed on January 8, 2009.\n\nThe track listing consists of several new songs, as well as songs that Blue October and 5591 have performed live. A live version of the song &quot;Weight of the World&quot; appeared on Blue October's 2004 album, Argue With a Tree. The song &quot;Say It&quot; was first performed at KDGE's Edgefest 17 on April 27, 2008[7] The festival was Steve Lillywhite's first time seeing Blue October perform, and the band's set, especially the song &quot;Say It&quot; cemented his desire to produce Blue October's next album.\n\nDuring an interview with the music webzine Playback:Stl, Justin described the song &quot;Blue Skies&quot; as being one of the few happy songs he has written, saying, &quot;There's nothing negative about it. It's all about beauty. It's really, really pretty and really, really happy, but it's going to be rocked out so crazy that people will kind of forget that it's a lovey lovey, dovey song.&quot;\n\nDuring concerts on July 4 and 5, 2008, Justin Furstenfeld confirmed that &quot;Say It&quot; and &quot;Weight of the World&quot; would be on the new album. On July 23, 2008, during a web chat with fans, Jeremy Furstenfeld confirmed the song &quot;Dirt Room&quot; would be on the album, and that of the new songs the band was recording, it was his favorite. Justin Furstenfeld first performed the songs &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;My Never&quot; at Stephenie Meyer's Breaking Dawn concerts in August 2008. Furstenfeld also confirmed March 2009 as the anticipated release date for the album.\n\nThe first single from the album, &quot;Dirt Room&quot; was performed live by the band during concerts in December 2008. Immediately following the concerts, radio stations in Austin, Dallas and Houston put the song into rotation. The single reached radio nationally on January 13, 2009, and was available to digital outlets on December 23, 2008.
