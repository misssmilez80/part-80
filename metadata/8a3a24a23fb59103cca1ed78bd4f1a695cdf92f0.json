It's called &quot;A state of Mind&quot; : a sonic onslaught of ferocious bass, head cracking drums and complex rhythms. With influences from experimental hiphop, broken beat and dubstep, infraBuse has grown, taking a next step in its evolution towards crafting its own form of futuristic glitch-hop. With a nod toward the resurgence in the instrumental hiphop beats-movement, as well as the still growing dubstep bass-oriented culture, infraBuse has this time injected a larger degree of dance sensibility into the music, in an effort to carve its niche with a new school dance floor sound.\n\nCheck this out if you like Glitch Hop artists like The Glitch Mob, Nosaj Thing, Beats Antique, Bassnectar, PantyRaid, Ill Gates, etc.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n001  Just Mean  -  3:30\n002  Up &amp; Down  -  3:08\n003  A state of Mind  -  4:02    \n004  Not Looking for Treble  -  3:41 \n005  The Easter Egg!  -  3:30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a3a24a23fb59103cca1ed78bd4f1a695cdf92f0","amp;dn":"infraBuse+-+A+state+of+Mind+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a3a24a23fb59103cca1ed78bd4f1a695cdf92f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,58,36,162,63,181,145,3,204,161,237,120,189,79,26,105,92,223,146,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
