Because the road surface is softer, ruts can form following the \n\nfirst pass.\n\nArgentinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Southern Hemisphere location means the rally will take place just before the start of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \n\nwinter from June to September, which will increase the challenge facing the crews as they negotiate the testing \n\nterrain in colder and wetter conditions. \n\n\n640x480 \n1024 framerate\nTV quality\nHD original converted for slower PCs, looks good on my 52&quot; TV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a28e717ec1b3046406dc6d7afcfcc6ad5cfb94a","amp;dn":"2011+WRC+Rally+Argentina","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a28e717ec1b3046406dc6d7afcfcc6ad5cfb94a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,40,231,23,236,27,48,70,64,109,198,215,175,207,204,106,213,207,185,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
