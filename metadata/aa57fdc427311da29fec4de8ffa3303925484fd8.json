Jaz Coleman and Geordie Walker of Killing Joke made a brief detour to Iceland (where Jaz thought apocalyptic earthquakes would begin) to record these three tracks with new wave group ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¾eyr (who may have had similar thoughts).\n\n\n1. Guess Again\n2. Take What's Mine\n3. The Catalyst\n\n\nThey were broadcast on John Peel's radio show but never again surfaced. I once made the acquaintence of a bloke who was close to Coleman, and he said that according to Coleman they WERE released on 7&quot; in Iceland. But this is probably not true (he also told me through Coleman how Peyr would stay at Coleman's mum's house and sleep on the floor when they came to the UK.....).\n\nThorstein Magnusson does not play guitar on these tracks apparently, as he began his solo project &quot;Stanya&quot;. The three guitars are Geordie Walker, Gudlaugur Ottarssonand Magnus Gudmundsson. One other myth is that Birgir Morgensen of Hamista/Spilafifl/Kukl/Med Noktum joined Killing Joke......?\n\nEnjoy and for fuck sake SEED ! It will only take a short while to spread these fine tracks around the world, even if it does end tomorrow.\n\nPlease also check my other rare icelandic new wave....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa57fdc427311da29fec4de8ffa3303925484fd8","amp;dn":"Jaz+Coleman+and+%C3%83%C5%BEeyr+-+Niceland+Demos+%5Bre-seed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa57fdc427311da29fec4de8ffa3303925484fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,87,253,196,39,49,29,162,159,236,77,232,255,163,48,57,37,72,79,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
