It has Interdimensionals, light meditations, secret technologies and other ones that will instead enlighten our wisdom.\n\n\n* Char ; My favourite folder. The folder of characteristics meaning several kinds of books to improve yourself. A kind of self help one, more like simiiar to enlightened man's book collection but specifically focusing on imrpoving oneself. Sharing experience in an intellectal way.\n\n\n* Circle of Light ; As you can predict from the folder title, it only has positive sources for it's seekers, many audios and songs for meditation which are relaxing and peaceful.

And yes Such an enormous collection reallt exists, no joke. I can say I have downloaded like %60 of the upcoming stuff and since my new net onnection is much higher I can finish it faster. But please be patient. Being student at the same time and working on projects is hard for me. I have also thought of putting up a Misc., Programs, Pictures, Movie, Music and Game folder but thought size would be too big and since everyone's favourite would be different. If I ever do I will put them on another torrent file and for games I will make the ultimate mugen, put up the ultimate rom image or maybe many enjoyable little games, flash ones, hgames, rpgs, etc. For movie will be the ones only ones that are worth watching to expand your view, Misc. I dont think I need it since I have already put there an uncategorized and unknown folder ready. Well not completel yet but will be. Music would be my favourite artists s?ch as NIN, Tool, MM, Anathema, Tori Amos and maybe some others. But Probably NIN the most since just like tv serie episodes you can find albums on other torrents so what I would have like for Trent would be &quot;nintology&quot; or something containing interviews, music video clips, rarest concerts, albums and limited editions. For programs it would be like a full protection from any kind of hackers, anti-hackers, spywares, viruses, rootkits, adwares, trojans, etc. For theme it would be for like i.e. windows xp black edition or my own. For pictures oh well It's still hard to finish it but I made a collection over 10 thousand pics and I've elected them so far it's a huge one and I like the way it turned out. For pics collection which I'm still collecting, creds goes to many dA users I can't efford to count now. +__+\n\nThank you all! If you have read an of it up until now. Thanks for sharing your time to read any of this and for your effort.\n\nHave a peaceful day ~\nMikagon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec4169948e6a9452aab5555a129ce8f54c260f38","amp;dn":"Idelat+V2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec4169948e6a9452aab5555a129ce8f54c260f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,65,105,148,142,106,148,82,170,181,85,90,18,156,232,245,76,38,15,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
