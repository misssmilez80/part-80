Dignitaries from rival kingdoms  \n                    descend on Camelot for peace talks, but what  \n                    King Alined really wants is war and he'll do  \n                    everything in his power to stir up hostilities,  \n                    even if it means using magic.

Chaos reigns in the palace and  \n                    Camelot is once more poised on the brink of  \n                    war. Can Merlin free Arthur's heart before the  \n                    prince loses his head in battle?         \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74c25f112274c8b7a9ea6a68f68c99bc71e9346","amp;dn":"Merlin.2008.S02E10.WS.PDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74c25f112274c8b7a9ea6a68f68c99bc71e9346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,76,37,241,18,39,76,139,122,158,166,166,143,104,201,155,199,30,147,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
