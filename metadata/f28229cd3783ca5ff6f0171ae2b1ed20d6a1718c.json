Earle made the album as a tribute to the founder of bluegrass music, Bill Monroe, who had died in 1996.\n\nThe album was nominated for a 2000 Grammy Award in the &quot;Best Bluegrass Album&quot; category (Earle's seventh Grammy nomination). Two tracks from the album were released as singles in the UK: &quot;Dixieland&quot; (distributed to radio only) and &quot;The Mountain&quot; (a commercial release).\n\n\n&quot;Texas Eagle&quot; \n&quot;Yours Forever Blue&quot; \n&quot;Carrie Brown&quot; \n&quot;I'm Still in Love With You&quot; \n&quot;Graveyard Shift&quot; \n&quot;Harlan Man&quot; \n&quot;The Mountain&quot; \n&quot;Outlaw's Honeymoon&quot; \n&quot;Connemara Breakdown&quot; \n&quot;Leroy's Dustbowl Blues&quot; \n&quot;Dixieland&quot; \n&quot;Paddy on the Beat&quot; \n&quot;Long, Lonesome Highway Blues&quot; \n&quot;Pilgrim&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f28229cd3783ca5ff6f0171ae2b1ed20d6a1718c","amp;dn":"steve+earle...the+mountain%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f28229cd3783ca5ff6f0171ae2b1ed20d6a1718c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,130,41,205,55,131,202,95,246,240,23,26,226,177,237,32,214,161,113,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
