It      \n    will allow you to create great looking flowcharts, quickly and        \n    easily, just by typing. If you are new to FlowBreeze, the best way    \n    to familiarize yourself with it is to look through the 5-step         \n    Getting Started Tutorial, which is the first section in the table     \n    of contents, below.                                                   \n                                                                          \n    FlowBreeze works by automating the built-in drawing tools in          \n    Excel. As a result, the topics covered in this help file are a        \n    combination of FlowBreeze-specific features and built-in Excel        \n    features. The flowcharts are generated using native Microsoft         \n    Office autoshapes, which means that they can be copied and pasted     \n    across Office applications such as Word, PowerPoint, and              \n    Publisher. Plus they can be edited in place by anyone using           \n    Microsoft Office, without needing additional software.                \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Use our keymaker to register the application.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
