But, they know that there is something \nmore. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that \nis standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through \ntrial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, \ntwo of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too \nvaluable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when \nthey are faced with the question, If you always want what you can't have, \nwhat do you want when you can have anything?\n\n\n\nIMDB-link........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/\nRating...........: Rated PG-13 for brief language.\n\nGenre............: Drama / Thriller / Sci-Fi\nSource...........: New Line Home Video R1 Retail &gt; DVDR &gt; ISO\nDistributor......: ThinkFilm Inc.\nCountry..........: USA\nYear.............: 2004\n\n\nDVD Format.......: NTSC\nFeature Length...: 77 mins\nDVD Size.........: DVD5\nScreen format....: 1.78:1 Anamorphic WS\nResolution.......: 720 x 480\nAudio Language...: English\nAudio Format.....: Dolby Digital 2.0\nSubtitles........: English (CC), Spanish\n\nTools Used.......: DVD Decrypter 3.5.4\n\n\nMenus..........: [x] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                 [ ] Stripped                                                \n                                                                            \nVideo..........: [x] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                 [ ] Re-encoded                                              \n                                                                            \nDVD-extras.....: [x] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                 [ ] Stripped\n                 [ ] Re-encoded\n                 [ ] None  \n\nWarnings.......: [x] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                 [ ] Stripped\n\n\n\nEXTRAS: \n\n# Audio commentary track by writer/director Shane Carruth\n# Audio commentary track by cast and crew\n# Trailer\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\n\nA PrimerMovie.com forums thread discussing the grain in the film.\n\nh__p://primermovie.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=197\n\nI have also included in this torrent a Primer timeline JPEG and a txt file \nwith 10 tips for watching and UNDERSTANDING the film.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor one to truely enjoy this film, you must understand it. With that said, my suggestion is to make use of and follow the guidelines in the txt file titled 10_Tips_2_Primer.txt located in the Extras directory included with this torrent.\n\nDon't even look at the Timeline untill you've watched the movie all the way through the first time, as it DOES contain spoilers about the film. Being completely confused the first time around is part of the experience. \n\n\nthanks goes to sp4zzj4zz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22a5d452d892f4c0cff72d738b8db1763a4a682","amp;dn":"Primer+-+WS+-+DD2.0+-+NTSC+-+DVD5+-+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22a5d452d892f4c0cff72d738b8db1763a4a682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,42,93,69,45,137,47,76,12,255,114,215,56,184,219,23,99,164,166,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
