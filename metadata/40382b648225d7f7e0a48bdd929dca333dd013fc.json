The existential ghost story Pitfall (Otoshiana), the shocking, erotic fable Woman in \n\nthe Dunes (Sunna no onna), and the sci-fiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“tinged nightmare The Face of Another (Tanin no kao) are among cinema's enduring enigmas and rarest pleasures.\n\n\nCONTENTS OF THE BOXSET:\n\n3 feature films + bonus disc:\n\nPitfall (Hiroshi Teshigahara, 1962, 97 min.)\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/827\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203612/\n\nWoman in the Dunes (Hiroshi Teshigahara, 1964, 97 min.)\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/826\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058625/\n\nThe Face of Another (Hiroshi Teshigahara, 1966, 124 min.)\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/828\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061065/\n\n# Four short films by Hiroshi Teshigahara: \nHokusai (1953), Ikebana (1956), Tokyo 1958 (1958), and Ako/White Morning (1963).\n# A new documentary about the working relationship beween Teshigahara and Kobo Abe.\n\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nDVD Size: 6.82 + 7.67 + 7.44 + 7.38 GB - Exact Untouched Copy\n\nTime (total): 521 minutes\n\nType: Black and White\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n\nSound (main features): Japanese\n\nSubtitles: optional English\n\n\n\nDISC DETAILS\n=========================\n\n------------------\nDISC ONE\n------------------\n\nPITFALL\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/827\n1962, 97 min.\nWhen a miner leaves his employers and treks out with his young son to become a migrant worker, he finds himself moving from one eerie landscape to another, intermittently \n\nfollowed (and photographed) by an enigmatic man in a clean white suit, and eventually coming face to face with his inescapable destiny. Hiroshi TeshigaharaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut feature and \n\nfirst collaboration with novelist Kobo Abe, Pitfall is many things: a mysterious, unsettling ghost story, a portrait of human alienation, and a compellingly surreal critique \n\nof soulless industry, shot in elegant black and white.\n\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nJapanese\n\n\n------------------\nDISC TWO\n------------------\n\nWOMAN IN THE DUNES\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/826\n1964, 147 min.\nOne of the sixties' great international art-house sensations, Woman in the Dunes was for many the grand unveiling of the surreal, idiosyncratic worldview of Hiroshi \n\nTeshigahara. Eija Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle that resides in a remote, vast desert; when he misses his \n\nbus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night in the home of a young widow (Kiyoko Kishida) who lives in a hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one \n\nof cinema's most bristling, unnerving, and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday Sisyphean struggle, for which Teshigahara \n\nreceived an Academy Award nomination for best director.\n\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nJapanese\n\n\n------------------\nDISC THREE\n------------------\n\nTHE FACE OF ANOTHER\nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/828\n1966, 124 min.\nA staggering work of existential science fiction, The Face of Another dissects identity with the sure hand of a surgeon. Okuyama (Yojimbo's Tatsuya Nakadai), after being \n\nburned and disfigured in an industrial accident and estranged from his family and friends, agrees to his psychiatrist's radical new experiment: a face transplant, created from \n\nthe mold of a stranger. As Okuyama is thus further alienated from the strange world around him, he finds himself giving in to his darker temptations. With unforgettable \n\nimagery, TeshigaharaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film explores both the limits and freedom in acquiring a new persona, and questions the notion of individuality itself.\n\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nJapanese\n\n\n------------------\nDISC FOUR\n------------------\n\n# Video essays on all three films by critic and festival programmer James Quandt.\n# Four short films by Hiroshi Teshigahara: Hokusai (1953), Ikebana (1956), Tokyo 1958 (1958), and Ako/White Morning (1963).\n# A new documentary about the working relationship beween Teshigahara and Kobo Abe, including interviews with Japanese-film scholars Donald Richie and Tadao Sato.\n\n\n=========================================\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40382b648225d7f7e0a48bdd929dca333dd013fc","amp;dn":"Hiroshi.Teshigahara.4DiSC.BoxSet.CRiTERION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40382b648225d7f7e0a48bdd929dca333dd013fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,56,43,100,130,37,215,247,224,164,139,221,146,157,202,51,61,208,19,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
