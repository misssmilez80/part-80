Real thing. Enjoy.\n\nRicky, Julian and Bubbles are about to get out of jail, and this time, Julian vows to go straight, even open a legit business. Soon the Boys will all be rich. At least thats what theyve told the parole board. But when they arrive back at the park, they find it's not the same old Sunnyvale - and it's not the same old Jim Lahey, Trailer Park Supervisor. Lahey's a new man, hasn't had a drink for two years. And he has plans - BIG PLANS - for Sunnyvale. But unfortunately for Lahey, Julian stands in his way. With his big plans for Sunnyvale going down the toilet, his relationship with Randy broken down, and having the Boys back in the park is all way too much pressure for him to bear. For Jim Lahey, the countdown to liquor day is on. Meanwhile, Julian's having problems of his own and the Boys are forced to resort to doing what they know best - breaking the law. Lahey's descent into the liquor coupled with the Boys descent into crime puts them all on a collision course to mayhem and destruction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ccce802afa51665654a4701277c260793abf42","amp;dn":"Trailer+Park+Boys%3A+Countdown+to+liquor+day+%5BCAM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ccce802afa51665654a4701277c260793abf42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,204,206,128,42,250,81,102,86,84,164,112,18,119,194,96,121,58,191,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
