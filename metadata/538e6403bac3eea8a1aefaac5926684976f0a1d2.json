The\neleventh session has two CDs and some exclusive productions signed by Fedde Le\nGrand.\n\nThe MOS Sessions compilation brings some of the most fresh house tracks of the\nmoment, mixed in a perfect manner, just like the MOS brand used us. The first CD is very\nsimple and it has a DJ set made of 12 tracks. It starts with PastaboysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ remix for Ricky L\nFeat M:ckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s track, Born Again. The house sound of this track is obvious not only thanks to\nthe rhythm, but also tanks to the rather interesting vocals. The mix passes discretely from\nprogressive house to electro and even tech-house and funky house. Some tracks that are\nreally remarkable here are Soul Elementz Feat. Sabrina Johnston - My Way Out, Prom\nFeat. Katherine Ellis - Do It, Dumb Dan - Mister Right. Fedde Le Grand brings nothing\nnew on this first CD, he rather gives us some excellent music for dancing in clubs. All this\nis brought to light by primordial elements like rhythm and energy.\n\nThe second CD starts very powerful with electro house. Kenton Slash Demon - Adaptor\nIncluded brings a euphoria that remains until the end of the second mix. After Switch -\nJust Bounce 2 This, the mix continues with two productions of Fedde Le Grand, the first\nTake No Shhh, and the second a remix for Camille Jones- Creeps. This second mix is\nmore organized and fuller of life than the first one, the genre being more like electro\nhouse and house. Some titles that really make the difference here are Microfunk aka\n2000 &amp; One &amp; Dave Ellesmere ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pecan, Filthy Rich - ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Like That and Erick E - The Beat\nIs RockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (Fedde Le Grand Remix)\n\nDisc 1\n\n   1.
