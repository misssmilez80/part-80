The data is then processed and displayed, and finally flows back from the progam to the hard disk via write operations.\n\nSandboxie changes the rules such that write operations do not make it back to your hard disk.\n\n-Intercept changes to both your files and registry settings, making it virtually\n impossible for any software to reach outside the sandbox.\n\n-Traps cached browser items into the sandbox as a by-product of normal operation,\n so when you throw away the sandbox, all the history records and other\n side-effects of your browsing disappear as well. \n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\nReport Bad Torrents Here:                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\nMy Torrents List And News:                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=45358&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=45358&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Torrent Request: ChattChitto(AT)ChattChitto(DOT)com\n[Put The Request Name In The SUBJECT Box &amp; Also Provide It's Webpage, Or Your Request Will Be Ignored Automatically]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:026b04fd36f2b29a434d1d796688c91dc67b8b83","amp;dn":"Sandboxie+v3.40+%2B+Serials+By+ChattChitto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"026b04fd36f2b29a434d1d796688c91dc67b8b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,107,4,253,54,242,178,154,67,77,29,121,102,136,201,29,198,123,139,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
