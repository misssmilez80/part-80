Robert Wise, 1965): Share the magical, heartwarming true-life story that has become the most popular family film of all time - Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'The Sound Of Music'. Julie Andrews lights up the screen as Maria, the spirited young woman who leaves the convent to become governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp, an autocratic widower whose strict household rules leave no room for music or merriment. Winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this timeless classic features some of the worldÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s best-loved songs.\n\nSouth Pacific (Dir. Joshua Logan, 1958): Blessed with a treasure of timeless songs, South Pacific combines the passionate, heartwarming romance of a naive young Navy nurse (Mitzi Gaynor) and an older French plantation owner (Rossano Brazzi) with South Seas splendour and a world at war while the breathtaking score is highlighted by some of the most romantic songs ever written.\n\nWest Side Story (Dir. Robert Wise, Jerome Robbins, 1961): Garnering a total of ten Academy Awards - including Best Picture of 1961 - West Side Story set a brilliant standard for movie musicals that remains unsurpassed to this day. Directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins from Ernest Lehman's spectacular screenplay, the film combines the unforgettable score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim with Robbins' exuberant choreography to create a transcendent fusion of realism and fantasy that will forever be a feast for the eye, the ear, and ultimately, the heart. A triumph on every level, this electrifying musical sets the ageless tragedy of Romeo and Juliet against a backdrop of gang warfare in the slums of 1950's New York.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef43cf975547aecea874d80443b5189476a0ecd","amp;dn":"3+disc+musical+boxset-sound+of+music-south+pacific-west+side+str","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef43cf975547aecea874d80443b5189476a0ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,244,60,249,117,84,122,236,234,135,77,128,68,59,81,137,71,106,14,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
