Charlton Heston plays the Christian soldier as cocky, unconventional maverick, and Laurence Olivier (behind heavy make-up and a thick black beard) is almost as good as his cagey nemesis the Mahdi, the Islamic holy warrior on a mission of annihilation.\n\nMore talk than spectacle, the film falls short of Lawrence but is nonetheless a compelling story of colonial politics, cynical manoeuvring and the unconventional heroics of another colourful British maverick abroad.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4598cad56c091eb468b0d5ef331b2d4ad6e59aa","amp;dn":"Khartoum+%281966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4598cad56c091eb468b0d5ef331b2d4ad6e59aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,89,140,173,86,192,145,235,70,139,13,94,243,49,178,212,173,110,89,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
