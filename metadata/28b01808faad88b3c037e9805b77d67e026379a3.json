An explosive\nexpos of the cruelty inflicted on Australian cattle exported to\nthe slaughterhouses of Indonesia.\n\n\nRight now in northern Australia, ships are being readied to\nload thousands of cattle to be transported to Indonesia\nwhere they will be fattened in feedlots and sent to abattoirs\nfor slaughter. Australia sends about 500,000 cattle there\neach year in a trade worth more than $300 million. Six million\ncattle have been sent to Indonesia since the trade began two\ndecades ago, supplying a growing demand for beef.\n\n\nDespite industry assurances that the welfare of cattle sent to\nIndonesia is &quot;generally good&quot;, Four Corners reveals that many\nthousands of these animals die slow and hideous deaths. Four\nCorners goes into the abattoirs that the Australian meat\nindustry does not want the public to see. The results will\nshock viewers and confront industry and government with the\nquestion: how much suffering must these animals endure for\nthe sake of profit?\n\n\nFollowing a report published January this year by industry and\ngovernment, painting a positive picture of conditions in\nIndonesia, animal welfare campaigners took their own\ncameras into abattoirs to record the conditions for\nthemselves. That footage reveals that Australian training of\nthe slaughtermen in Indonesia has been grossly inadequate.\nAnimals smash their heads repeatedly on concrete as they\nstruggle against ropes, take minutes to die in agony after\nrepeated often clumsy cuts to the throat. In some cases\nthere is abject and horrifying cruelty - kicking, hitting, eye-\ngouging and tail-breaking - as workers try to force the cattle\nto go into the slaughter boxes installed by the Australian\nindustry, with Australian Government support.\n\n\nThe program shows video footage taken by its own team and\nseparately by animal welfare activists across a range of\nslaughterhouses. The Australian cattle industry insists its\ntraining programs in Indonesia are effective, what this\nfootage shows is cattle being subjected to a range of\nhorrifying acts of brutality, many the result of the workmen's\ninability to handle the cattle inside the processing plants. As\none eye witness put it:\n\n\n&quot;We'd assumed that because there were greater level of\nindustry involvement in Indonesia, the treatment of livestock\nwould've been better. But we couldn't have been more\nwrong.&quot;\n\n\nm\n\n\nBy request here is the extremely disturbing Four Corners from\nthis week.\nTHIS DOCO CONTAINS VERY GRAPHIC IMAGES, you have\nbeen warned.\n\n\n \n\n\n _ W4F is looking for _\n\n 100mbit+ affil sites with archives\n\n Broadcast/Network/PPV Cappers with PDTV/HDTV Sources (US/UK/AU)\n\n People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping\n\n TV/WWE/MMA DVD Rippers/Suppliers\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;700744161302150730171d11191c5e131f1d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Releasing TV since 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28b01808faad88b3c037e9805b77d67e026379a3","amp;dn":"Four.Corners.2011.05.30.A.Bloody.Business.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28b01808faad88b3c037e9805b77d67e026379a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,176,24,8,250,173,136,179,192,55,233,128,91,119,214,126,2,99,121,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
