After releasing\n\nthree classic power/prog metal masterpieces on the immortal Metal Blade Records,\n\nthe band took some time off and now returns several years later with their\n\ncomeback release on Retroactive Records. &quot;Beneath the Shadows&quot; is a concept\n\nalbum based on a story written by vocalist, Chaz Bond. The theme of the album is\n\nan intriguing tale, centering around the choices, experiences and decisions of\n\nCamren, the main character, who struggles to find his way in and out of darkness\n\nand into the light. Bond is a critically acclaimed vocalist in the prog/power\n\nmetal genre and often compared to Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden), Geoff Tate\n\n(Queensryche), and Jimmy Brown (Deliverance). The soaring vocal melodies are\n\nhook-filled and charismatic. The guitar work is thick, powerful metal, filled\n\nwith great riffs and hooks. Look no further for powerful, intelligent lyrics and\n\ntop notch METAL!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9cd21fddb75c80822fa3e506292832e28903933","amp;dn":"Jacobs_Dream-Beneath_The_Shadows-2009-SSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9cd21fddb75c80822fa3e506292832e28903933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,205,33,253,219,117,200,8,34,250,62,80,98,146,131,46,40,144,57,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
