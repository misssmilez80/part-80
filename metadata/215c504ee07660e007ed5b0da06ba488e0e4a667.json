This DVD contains clips of songs and interviews taken from Primus' 2003 tour. It also shows random clips between songs and interviews. The title of the DVD stems from an incident in the film where drummer Tim Alexander got food poisoning from bad fish at a restaurant, but still had to play a show that night and performed perfectly.\n\nDirected by Matthew J.
