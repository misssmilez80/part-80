Normally you can't download this because you need to register your game at GOG. So I found this and uploaded as a torrent for those who need this. I've been trying to patch the game tp 1.1 but I didn't managed it yet. Maybe it's because I have the Black Box version or I need to reinstall it but I'm not gonna bother with that since people at forums says there's no huge differences. Skidrow will relase their version of patcher eventually so I'm waiting. But if you want to try, here you go. Hope this helps!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e472cfa98a180c6b57acf9c601a4e4736aa3a484","amp;dn":"The+Witcher+2+1.1+GOG+Patcher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e472cfa98a180c6b57acf9c601a4e4736aa3a484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,114,207,169,138,24,12,107,87,172,249,198,1,164,228,115,106,163,164,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
