This is a fascinating, irresistibly written ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbig-pictureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ work that highlights and explains the impact of four elements that when occurring simultaneously, are the fundamental building blocks for human progress: Property rights, which drive creativity Scientific rationalism, which permits the freedom to innovate without fear of retribution; Capital markets, which provide funding for people to pursue their visions; Transportation/communication, which allows for the effective transfer of ideas and products. Meticulously researched, splendidly told, and featuring a new preface and introduction, The Birth of Plenty explains the interplay of the events, philosophies, and related phenomena that were nothing less than the crucible of the modern age. This is one of the rare books that will change how you look at the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f533243635cbba48be8450d50ed57716361bb49","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+%5B2010%5D+The+Birth+of+Plenty+How+the+Prosperity+of+the+Mode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f533243635cbba48be8450d50ed57716361bb49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,83,50,67,99,92,187,164,139,232,69,13,80,237,87,113,99,97,187,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
