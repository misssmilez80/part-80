Reduced is the Zombies reasoning and lots of obvious special make-up effects. The level of gore and carnage has been increased. Finally this is a trure Romero Zombie movie.\n\n\nTagline: For Every One Human Alive There Are One Millions Zombies. What Would You Do?\n\nName - Romero's Land Of The Dead: Unrated FanCut\nOriginal Name - Land Of The Dead\nFilm Studio - Universal\nEditing - Mollo\nOriginal Release - 2005\nFanEdit Release - July 2008\nOriginal Runtime - 1h37 Mins.\nNew Runtime - 1h21 Mins.\n\nDVD Features: Menu and Scene Selection, Extras - The FanCut Floor - NTSC\n\nFootage\n\nRomero's Land Of The Dead\nRomero's Dawn Of The Dead\nRomero's Day Of The Dead\nRomero's Diary Of The Dead\nTruman Show\nV For Vendetta\nDawn Of The Dead (Remake)\n\nConceptual Improvements/Advancements Of Edit Over Original\n\nWhat I have tried to do with this FanEdit is to create a film more in keeping with the three previous Romero Dead Films. I have removed money as a motivator and reduced the Zombies reasoning. I have also removed the more obvious special make-up effects and increased the level of gore and carnage. I have also trimmed the more formulaic dialogue and attempts at light humor. There is a new prologue, whole new sequences and a new ending.\n\nI will let you judge if this works or not.\n\nCuts Removed/Added/Extended\n\nContains Serious Spoilers!!!!\n(check the link)\n\n\nNotes On Sound Editing\n\nNew: Sounds of sickening carnage have been added.\nNew: Many Music cues have been added.\nNew: Numerous Sound Effects and Ambience have been added.\n\nMany other cuts and changes have been made that are not listed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913152ca12321df5e4232a22459613a20ec1e93c","amp;dn":"Romero%5C%27s+Land+Of+The+Dead%3A+Unrated+FanCut+%5Bfanedit.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913152ca12321df5e4232a22459613a20ec1e93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,49,82,202,18,50,29,245,228,35,42,34,69,150,19,162,14,193,233,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
