Emmy award winner and seven times Bafta winner Gervais proves his Hollywood worth in this transatlantic feel good love story about a man, a woman and a ghost.\n\nPincus is a New York City dentist with horrendous people skills. When a routine surgery goes awry, Pincus is pronounced dead, but is miraculously revived seven minutes later. The ill-mannered Manhattanite suffers only one lasting after-effect; the ability to see and speak with the dead. Word soon gets out in the spirit community and Pincus is irritated to discover he's the go-to-guy for every phantom with unfinished business in the city.\n\nAt the forefront of the ghostly mob is recently deceased Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear - Little Miss Sunshine, Baby Mama), who is determined to stop the remarriage of his widow, Gwen (TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©a Leoni - Spanglish, Fun with Dick and Jane). The laughs unfold when the prickly and romantically inexperienced Pincus, smitten with Gwen, tries to woo her away from her betrothed - with hysterically awkward results.\n\nWith sharp performances and beautifully dry Gervais execution, Ghost Town won't fail to make viewers laugh out loud. With a host of special features including commentary from renowned director David Koepp and 'making Ghost Town', this is one DVD that should be in the collection of every Ricky Gervais fan.\n\n\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 1 140 Kbps\nLength : 800 MiB for 1h 38mn 5s 920ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 976 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 576 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5597fe5c93c3c5ea893d529069b1c02074df408b","amp;dn":"GHOST+TOWN+AAC+H.264+5.1+BY+WINKER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5597fe5c93c3c5ea893d529069b1c02074df408b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,151,254,92,147,195,197,234,137,61,82,144,105,177,192,32,116,223,64,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
