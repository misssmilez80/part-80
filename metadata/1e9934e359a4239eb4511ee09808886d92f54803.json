It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, Lateralus. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.\n\n&quot;Schism&quot; was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\n\nSchism is reknowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times. The song begins with one measure of 5/4, followed by 21 measures of alternating 5/8 and 7/8, until the first interlude, which consists of one bar of 3/8, three bars of 13/8, and a bar of 10/8 (This can be also interpreted as four 13/8 bars, but played with a 3/8 upbeat).\n\nThe following verse is eight bars of 6/4, which is then followed by an interlude that repeats the pattern of the first. The next section is four bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. Another eight-bar verse in 6/4 follows, followed by another interlude, except the final 10/8 bar is replaced with an 11/8 bar.\n\nThis introduces the middle section, which consists of four bars of 7/4, before moving into a pattern of alternating one bar each of 12/8 and 15/8, repeated twelve times. Following this, there are three bars of 4/4, one bar of 2/4, and four bars of 4/4 setting up another section, which is two bars of 9/8 followed by a bar of 10/8, that pattern again, a single bar of 9/8 followed by a 13/8 bar. This leads to an alternating set of 9/8 and 5/8, appearing four times before a bar of 9/8 and a bar of 6/8. This leads to the 'outro' section, which has a 6/4 meter for eight bars, followed by eight bars of 4/4 to end the song. In all, the song changes meters 47 times.\n\nThe band has comically said that the song is in &quot;6.5/8&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9934e359a4239eb4511ee09808886d92f54803","amp;dn":"Tool+-+Schism+%5BAVI%5D+%7EThe_Spiral","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9934e359a4239eb4511ee09808886d92f54803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,153,52,227,89,164,35,158,180,81,30,224,152,8,136,109,146,245,72,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
