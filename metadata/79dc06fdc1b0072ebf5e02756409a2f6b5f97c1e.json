As elegantly designed as Macs are, a connected world means that their popularity attracts the attention of malware writers and virus engineers. Not only can malware and other threats attack the Mac OS X platform directly, but Macs can also serve as a carrier of Windows or Linux-based threats. Network shares, email and removable media like USB keys are easy ways easy ways for multiplatform malware to spread under the radar.\n\n The MacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meteoric rise in popularity makes the Mac OS X platform more likely to be a target for cybercriminals looking to profit from the perception that Macs are invulnerable to from viruses, worms, trojans and other threats. ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4 for Mac OS X brings to the Mac world protection that Windows users have trusted in and depended on: the smart proactive detection and small footprint of our ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology. ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4 will keep you and your network safe from emerging Mac OS X and cross-platform threats without system slowdowns. Advanced heuristic technology recognizes and nullifies novel threats while other AV solutions are still waiting hours or days for signature updates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79dc06fdc1b0072ebf5e02756409a2f6b5f97c1e","amp;dn":"ESET+Smart+Security+FRESH+keys+15%2F5%2F11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79dc06fdc1b0072ebf5e02756409a2f6b5f97c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,220,6,253,193,176,7,46,191,94,2,117,100,9,162,246,181,249,124,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
