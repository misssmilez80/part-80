It is a arcade-style zombie game where you protect two barricades from the attack of zombies! \n\nFor sprites, we used Metal Slug, Mario, and maybe some pictures we just found on the internet. Background music comes from the Call of Duty: Black Ops - Zombies Soundtrack. \n\nTry it out, and comment on it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e7a81e574a7e0c9fb3c4f1cb0e040a9eedca3a","amp;dn":"Zombies%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e7a81e574a7e0c9fb3c4f1cb0e040a9eedca3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,231,168,30,87,74,126,12,159,179,196,241,203,14,4,10,158,237,202,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
