Cyrus promoted the song by performing it at several venues, including on her first international concert tour, Wonder World Tour.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Party in the U.S.A.,&quot; directed by Chris Applebaum, premiered in ABC's music lounge on September 23, 2009. A sneak peek of the video premiered earlier the same day on Dancing with the Stars in the United States. The video then premiered to the United Kingdom in Cyrus's official UK MySpace on September 24.\n\nApplebaum told Jocelyn Vena of MTV news that Cyrus came to him with a vision of a &quot;high-gloss, glamorous white trash&quot; video that would also pay tribute to one of her favorite films, Grease, and to her parents' courting days. Applebaum says the video &quot;sprang forward from that scene in Grease where John Travolta is singing ... and he gets out of the car and goes to jungle gym and sits in one of the swings and sings the song at night as projections go in the background&quot;.\n\nThe video commences in a defunct drive-in theater, named the Corral Drive-In after the location of one of Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus' first dates. Cyrus arrives at the theater in a black 1979 Pontiac Trans Am, the car her mother drove when she was younger. Cyrus wears blue short shorts, a brown slightly low-cut tank top, a black bra, cowboy boots, and a cardigan. As she exits the car she is joined by four of her friends. Other teenagers continue to arrive in vintage cars. Cyrus sings while standing in the back of a pick-up truck with a microphone in her hand and dancing with her friends. The video proceeds to Cyrus leaning against a wall which reads &quot;Corral Drive-In&quot;. As the video progresses in both settings, an American flag unravels before a single wall in a vacant landscape and, afterward, Cyrus performs before it while being sprinkled with glitter. The video then features shots of Cyrus and background dancers at night in the theater, balancing on swings and climbing on a jungle gym. In the conclusion of the music video, Cyrus and her friends perform the song on a stage while the a projection of the American flag and the letters &quot;USA&quot; flash behind them.\n\nVena of MTV news described the video as &quot;reminiscent of Cyrus' performance of the track on the Teen Choice Awards over the summer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ minus the pole dancing.&quot; However, The Huffington Post believed that though Cyrus &quot;[kept] it real&quot; in the video, her dance moves remained risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. LimeLife's Susie Anderson took issue with her clothing, saying she enjoys &quot;Party in the U.S.A.&quot;'s &quot;fun and [..] young feel&quot;, but that Cyrus' &quot;extremely short shorts and a cleavage-bearing shirt&quot; is &quot;a bit racy for a 16 year old.&quot; Bill Lamb of About.com felt the video celebrated being &quot;young and American&quot;, thereby fitting the &quot;themes and sound of the song nearly perfectly. [... The] clip remains gently laidback matching the tempo and tenor of the song.&quot; The music video onhas over 30 million views since it's release on September 23.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5147c9b5211d082c708d3820777a71f2e6cd1ed5","amp;dn":"Miley+Cyrus+-+Party+In+The+USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5147c9b5211d082c708d3820777a71f2e6cd1ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,71,201,181,33,29,8,44,112,141,56,32,119,122,113,242,230,205,30,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
