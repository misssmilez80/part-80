They met at Harlem's White Rock Baptist Church in 1964. After having recorded unsuccessfully as a duo, they joined aspiring solo artist and former member of the Ikettes, Josie Jo Armstead, at the Scepter/Wand label where their compositions were recorded by Ronnie Milsap (&quot;Never Had It So Good&quot;), Maxine Brown (&quot;One Step At A Time&quot;), as well as the Shirelles and Chuck Jackson. Another of the trio's songs &quot;Let's Go Get Stoned&quot; gave Ray Charles a number one U.S. R&amp;B hit in 1966. That same year Ashford &amp; Simpson joined Motown where their best-known songs included &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;You're All I Need To Get By&quot;, &quot;Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, and &quot;Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)&quot;. As performers, Ashford and Simpson's best-known song is &quot;Solid&quot; (1984 US and 1985 UK).\n\nThe duo essentially had two careers: one as a successful writing and producing team and the other as singers and performers themselves. They started their career in the mid-1960s, writing for artists such as The 5th Dimension (&quot;California Soul&quot;), Aretha Franklin (&quot;Cry Like A Baby&quot;), and Ray Charles (&quot;Let's Go Get Stoned&quot; and &quot;'I Don't Need No Doctor&quot;). Their work with Charles brought them to the attention of Motown chief Berry Gordy.\n\nJoining the Motown staff in 1966, Ashford &amp; Simpson were paired with the vocal duo of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and they wrote and/or produced all but one of the late-1960s Gaye/Terrell singles, including hits such as the original version of &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;, &quot;Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, and &quot;You're All I Need to Get By&quot;. According to Gaye in the book &quot;Divided Soul,&quot; Simpson did most of the vocals on the last album he did with Terrell, &quot;Easy,&quot; as a way of Terrell's family to have additional income as she was battling an ultimately fatal brain tumor. (Simpson is quoted as denying this in a book written by Terrell's sister Ludie Montgomery.)\n\nAshford &amp; Simpson wrote and produced almost all the songs on three 1970's albums for former Supreme Diana Ross including her first solo album Diana Ross (&quot;Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)&quot; and &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot;), Surrender (&quot;Remember Me&quot;), and The Boss.\n\nOther Motown artists that Ashford &amp; Simpson worked with included Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips (Didn't You Know You'd Have To Cry Sometime&quot;, &quot;The Landlord&quot;, &quot;Bourgie, Bourgie&quot;, and &quot;Taste Of Bitter Love&quot;), Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles (&quot;Who's Gonna Take The Blame&quot;), The Marvelettes (&quot;Destination:Anywhere&quot;), The Supremes (&quot;Some Things You Never Get Used To&quot;), and The Dynamic Superiors (&quot;Shoe, Shoe Shine&quot;).\n\nOther artists with whom Ashford &amp; Simpson had hits were Teddy Pendergrass (&quot;Is It Still Good To You&quot;), The Brothers Johnson (&quot;Ride-O-Rocket&quot;), Chaka Khan, both on her own (&quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; and &quot;Clouds,&quot; ) and with Rufus (&quot;Keep It Comin'&quot; and &quot;Ain't Nothin' But a Maybe&quot; )\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d5fade0256319f8c5ee8c6fb7191b7708c0487b","amp;dn":"Ashford+%26+Simpson+-+I%5C%27ll+Be+There+For+You++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d5fade0256319f8c5ee8c6fb7191b7708c0487b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,95,173,224,37,99,25,248,197,238,140,111,183,25,27,119,8,192,72,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
