Once upon a time, Ben Kalmen (Douglas) had everything a man could possibly want -- a high-paying job, a beautiful wife, and a spacious Manhattan apartment -- but now all of that is a distant memory. The former owner of a successful auto dealership, Ben has recently lost everything thanks to his own inability to resist his impulses. But the resilient Ben isn\\\\\\'t the type of guy to stay down for the count, and lately things are starting to look up for him again. Despite being divorced from his former college sweetheart Nancy (Susan Sarandon), Ben still manages to see his daughter, Susan (Jenna Fischer), and his grandson on a regular basis, and his new girlfriend, Jordan (Mary-Louise Parker), may have just the connections needed to help the floundering businessman get his career back on track. When Ben takes Jordan\\\\\\'s college-bound daughter, Allyson (Imogen Poots), on a tour of a prospective school, however, his steely new resolve is put to the ultimate test.\n\n\nR, 1 hr. 30 min.\n\nDrama, Comedy\n\nDirected By:Brian Koppelman , David Levien\n\n\nIn Theaters: May 21, 2010 Wide\n\nOn DVD: Sep 7, 2010\n\nUS Box Office:$4.4M\n\nAnchor Bay Films\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad59b7f7bd08c854c796e820e5541073dc3638b","amp;dn":"Solitary+Man+2009+With+Greek+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad59b7f7bd08c854c796e820e5541073dc3638b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,213,155,127,123,208,140,133,76,121,110,130,14,85,65,7,61,195,99,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
