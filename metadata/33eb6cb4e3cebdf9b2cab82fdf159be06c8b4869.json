It serves as the second single from her fourth album All I Ever Wanted. The song, in addition to another track on the album (&quot;Long Shot&quot;), was recorded by Katy Perry for her unreleased album (A) Katy Perry. And both songs, in their Katy Perry versions, were leaked to the internet months prior their release on All I Ever Wanted.\n\n&quot;I Do Not Hook Up&quot; was sent to Australian radio stations on March 30, 2009 and was released to American radio stations on April 14, 2009. The song was written by Greg Wells, Katy Perry, Kara DioGuardi and produced by Howard Benson.\n\nThe music video was directed by Bryan Barber and was shot March 25, 2009. A 30 second preview recently debuted of the video on Clarkson's official website. Clarkson revealed to Access Hollywood the plot of the video:&quot;I go into fantasy mode. So the girl thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good girl, in her fantasy, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always hooking up. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m throwing guys around&quot;. The video was supposed to be released on April 20th on MTV , but was leaked on April 18th. Clarkson stated in the Access Hollywood interview that there are 3 guys for her in the video, but in the final version of the video there are only 2, meaning that the fantasy with the third man was cut off from the video.\n\nThe video begins with Clarkson at a fancy dinner dressed in a blue blazer, red dress, and sporting a high bun. The rich people around her are laughing at stereotypical blue-blood jokes until one calls for the waiter (played by Lee Kholafai) to bring more alcohol. Immediately, the intro riffs of &quot;I Do Not Hook Up&quot; begin as Clarkson sets eyes on the waiter, who pops the cork off the champagne bottle. Clarkson then sings seductively to him until he walks over to her. At the beginning of the chorus, she tosses him onto the table, lets down her hair, and removes her blazer. The two kiss passionately in front of the now shocked dinner guests and Clarkson feeds him a chocolate-covered strawberry. A flash of horizontal diffusion awakens her from her fantasy and she is sitting next to a dorky man eating chocolate-covered strawberries.\n\nNext, Clarkson is shown singing with wavy hair, a sparkling top with black leggings, and bright pink lip gloss. Then, she is shown with straight hair and a dress standing around a table in a bar with two female friends. She spots a man playing pool and instantly begins to fantasize about him. The chorus breaks in and performer Kelly rocks out with clips of straight-haired Kelly dancing with her friends on the bar. When the bridge kicks in, Kelly is staring at the man across the room, still singing. Right after the high note, straight-haired Kelly is dancing on the bar, but slips in her heels and falls. The music immediately stops and everyone in the bar stops to wait for her to resurface. She jumps up, holding her beer, and screams &quot;woo!&quot; as the party continues. The video ends with Clarkson finally walking up to the man and singing to him as if she knows what they both want. As she gets close, another horizontally diffused flash brings her out of her fantasy and standing in the same place with her girlfriends.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33eb6cb4e3cebdf9b2cab82fdf159be06c8b4869","amp;dn":"Kelly+Clarkson+-+I+Do+Not+Hook+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33eb6cb4e3cebdf9b2cab82fdf159be06c8b4869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,235,108,180,227,206,189,249,178,202,184,47,223,21,155,224,108,139,72,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
