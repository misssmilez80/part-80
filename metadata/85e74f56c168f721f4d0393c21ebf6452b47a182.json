After several demos and trips to Toronto, Harlequin was finally discovered playing in a tiny bar in Toronto by representatives of Jack Douglas, legendary producer of Aerosmith, Patti Smith and John Lennon.  Ironically, the scouts for Douglas' company had actually intended to see Goddo, the band playing downstairs, but were turned away due to a sold old show.  Instead they retired upstairs to a much smaller bar - only to be blown away by the band, playing a high-energy set of strong original songs for only a handful of people.  This chance meeting led to a production deal with Douglas.\n\nWith DouglasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ help, Harlequin signed a deal with CBS/Epic (home to Cheap Trick and Eddie Money) in 1979.  The band proceeded to amaze everyone at the label by pushing the first release &quot;Victim of a Song&quot;(1979) to gold status through sheer hard-work, incessant touring, word of mouth and solid song-writing.  Songs like Sweet Things in Life, You are the Light and Survive introduced the band to radio to many markets in Canada - especially Western Canada. \n\nSweet Things in Life\nSurvive\nWhat's Your Name?\nVictim Of A Song\nYou Are The Light\nWho Knows (What A Love Can Do)\nShame Shame\nTurn Around\nBarely Alive\n\nMy rip from vinyl.\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e74f56c168f721f4d0393c21ebf6452b47a182","amp;dn":"Harlequin+-+Victim+of+a+Song+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e74f56c168f721f4d0393c21ebf6452b47a182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,231,79,86,193,104,247,33,244,208,57,60,33,235,246,69,43,71,161,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
