Best known in the West for his collaborations with Bono and Peter Gabriel, N'Dour is one of the most beloved musicians in pop music and his legendary career has spanned decades.\n\nIn 2004, responding to negative perceptions about his Muslim faith, N'Dour recorded EGYPT, a deeply spiritual album dedicated to a more tolerant view of Islam. In a critical and career-defining moment, the album was awarded the 2004 GrammyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® for BEST WORLD MUSIC ALBUM. While Western audiences embraced N'Dour's brave musical message, it encountered a serious religious backlash in his native country of Senegal where N'Dour is considered a national hero. Local critics and the media accused him of insulting Islam, arguing that pop and religious music should not mix.\n\nCombining unprecedented images of Senegal's most sacred Muslim rituals, vibrant concert performances filmed around the world, and intimate access to N'Dour and his family, I BRING WHAT I LOVE chronicles the difficult path this remarkable artist must take. It is a stirring journey of faith, redemption, and the power of music to overcome intolerance.\n\nOscilloscope Pictures (released 2010)\n\n102 minutes\nDVD-9 ISO\n5.1 surround &amp; stereo\n1.78:1 aspect ratio \nNTSC\nOptional english subtitles\n\nSpecial features:\nRehearsal for first live performances of Egypt\n&quot;Ansak&quot; - homage to Umm Kulthum\n&quot;Birima&quot; performance\nA visit with Wyclef Jean\nRecording &quot;The Messenger&quot; with griot singer Moustapha Mbaye\nOxfam photo shoot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42086c1eb05acde8ab282dc88f85a26758501d9","amp;dn":"Youssou+N%5C%27Dour+-+I+Bring+What+I+Love+%28DVD-9+ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42086c1eb05acde8ab282dc88f85a26758501d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,32,134,193,235,5,172,222,138,178,130,220,136,248,90,38,117,133,1,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
