The film was directed by John D. Hancock, and stars Nick Nolte, Ernie Hudson, and Rita Taggart.\n\n Nick Nolte ...  Lee Umstetter \n Ernie Hudson ...  Bagdad \n Rita Taggart ...

It's about the ways in which working together changes them and the ways in which it doesn't.&quot; \n\nHancock, who used to be the director of the San Francisco Actors Workshop, did some work with the convict Rick Cluchey and his San Quentin Drama Group, (whose late 1960s show The Cage toured the U.S. and Europe), and the film grew out of Hancock's contact with Clucheys company and out of his and Dorothy Tristan's research into other prison theatre groups.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb68d98c7a925300a6f4e6e4b0a0928920ff31c8","amp;dn":"Weeds+%28VHS%29+%5B1987%5D+Nick+Nolte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb68d98c7a925300a6f4e6e4b0a0928920ff31c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,104,217,140,122,146,83,0,166,244,230,228,176,160,146,137,32,255,49,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
