A TV crew on assignment        \n           in the area happens to capture this humiliation on             \n           camera, and this example of police incompetence is soon        \n           the lead story in every news bulletin. Public confidence       \n           in law and order now suffers irreparable harm. The head        \n           of the Moscow force welcomes a public search-and-destroy       \n           operation against these thugs, the brainchild of Katya,        \n           his PR director. She proposes that the capture of this         \n           dangerous gang be transformed into a live TV show of a         \n           kind never seen before. At this point she cannot know          \n           that the gang leader's life-and-death struggle with the        \n           police is destined to lead to a media duel. Besieged in a      \n           huge apartment block, the crooks hold hostage a father         \n           and his son and daughter. A massive special forces rescue      \n           operation is mounted but fails miserably. Undaunted by         \n           this setback, Katya and her team of specialists                \n           manipulate the footage to create the illusion of victory.      \n           Incensed by this version of events broadcast on TV, gang       \n           leader Herman strikes back. Using the boy's computer he        \n           uploads to the Internet his own footage of this debacle        \n           and starts broadcasting from the apartment via a web           \n           camera. The first shots have now been fired in an              \n           information war, whose survivors and victors have yet to       \n           emerge.                                                        \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Andrey Merzlikin........... : ....................Smirnov      \n           Yevgeni Tsyganov........... : .....................Herman      \n           Mariya Mashkova............ : ......................Katya      \n           Sergey Garmash............. : .....................Killer      \n           Maksim Konovalov........... : .......................Kley      \n           Aleksey Frandetti.......... : .......................Orda      \n           Pavel Klimov............... : .....................Kolyan      \n           Sergei Vesnin.............. : ........................Kon      \n           Artyom Semakin............. : .....................Valery      \n           Viktor Chepelov............ : ......................Sanya      \n           David Stepanyan............ : .....................Hamlet      \n           Oleg Chernigov............. : ..................Mikhalych      \n           Pyotr Rytov................ : ...................Polyakov      \n           Yuri Shlykov............... : ...................Boldyrev      \n           Pavel Sukhov............... : .......Boldyrev's assistant      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
