With it, high schoolers can receive text message alerts on their cell phones without the teacher knowing.\nAs people age, many develop whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s known as aging ear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a loss of the ability to hear higher-frequency sounds.\nThe ring tone is a spin-off of technology that was originally meant to repel teenagers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ not help them. A Welsh security company developed the tone to help shopkeepers disperse young people loitering in front of their stores while leaving adults unaffected. The company called their product the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMosquito.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nDonna Lewis, a teacher in Manhattan, says her colleague played the ring for a classroom of first-graders ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and all of them could hear it, while the adults couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hear anything.\n\nInstall Ringtones From Your Computer\n\nStep 1\n\nDownload ringtone to your computer.\n\nStep 2\n\nConnect your phone to your computer using the data cable that is supplied with the phone. After-market data cables are also available for purchase.\n\nStep 3\n\nSync your phone to your computer but you'll need mobile phone pc management software like Nokia PC Suite, Motorola Phone Tools, BitPim (CDMA phone data management free software)  that will recognize your phone and handle the file transfer.\n\nJust run the software, and with the plug in place you'll see a list of the existing photos, ring tones, or videos currently on your cell phone.\n\nChoose the folder on your PC that contains the files you want to move, select the files (or folders) and transfer them over to your cell phone. You can also use these software to transfer photos or ringtones from your cell phone to your computer. Consult your user's manual for additional instructions specific to your brand and model.\n\nStep 4\n\nDisconnect your phone from your computer. You may have to trash (apple)/safely remove (PC) the device first to disconnect properly.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df3f1c48fa1c1e15a57065c9d926c892b435fc4","amp;dn":"Thirteen+Ringtones+That+Adults+Can%5C%27t+Hear+%5BNugmonster%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df3f1c48fa1c1e15a57065c9d926c892b435fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,243,241,196,143,161,193,225,90,87,6,92,157,146,108,137,43,67,95,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
