As Gunslinger shut the psy-antennas down, lots of stalkers rushed to the center of the Zone trying to lay their hands on the treasures it conceals. But only few made their way into it safely, as a new faction war broke out. The survivals are mostly neutrals, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½DutyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½FreedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ members as well as some bandits. As the psy-barrier broke down, the military started to develop an operation called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½FairwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in order to establish full control over the new territories. As a first step of the operation, 5 reconnaissance helicopters were sent to investigate the new areas and find a safer way through the anomalous fields for their full-scale ground operation. Despite all the precautions made, the operation fails with all HINDs being vanished from the radars leaving only approximate coordinates of the crash sites. The player takes a role of major Degtyarev, an ex-stalker who signed the contract with the military in the past, and now is an undercover agent sent to the center of the Zone to investigate the reasons behind the operation failure. The Zone. First of all, there will be no faction wars in Call of Pripyat, the number of NPCs will be greatly reduced, as opposed to Clear Sky, and the developers promise us to create a bigger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½back to the roots, explore-the-surroundingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feeling of the game, more common to the original: Shadow of Chernobyl. Among other game improvements, the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s locations are one of the most important ones with three new huge locations that include a photorealistic Exclusion Zone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pripyat (the eastern part of the town), Yanov railway station, Jupiter factory, Kopachi village and others, recreated by their true-to-life prototypes with the use of satellite photographs. There are also two underground locations which are kept secret for now. The first location, where the game starts, is Zaton (The Backwater) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a huge 1.5ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€1.5 km area, featuring a dried out river with some shipwrecks, a factory of some sort and lots of anomalies. As the player arrives to Zaton, other stalkers have already accustomed to the area, so we can find the Bar in one of the shipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s carcasses, the bases of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½DutyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½FreedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ factions who share one ship by having a cease-fire agreement (but only within the walls of their base), and the mercenary base somewhere in the industrial area. The Blowouts (aka Emissions) will now be random and deeply incorporated in the local ecosystem: with every Blowout, new artifacts are born in the anomalies, and some anomalies will change their positions (only random anomalies and not the unique looking, static anomalous fields). Stalkers will seek cover during Blowouts and will fight for it, if members of others factions will attempt to use the same hideout; this works for the player as well: staying on the open field during the Blowout is lethal, but finding a safe spot (they will be marked on your map) can cost you your life as well, if it is already occupied by your rivals. The new types of anomalies will also be introduced in the game. It is also worth mentioning, that now both stalkers and mutants will have their own day/night cycle, with mutants being more active at night, while stalkers will be going to bed. As for the mutant additions, we will see the good old, finally made functional Chimera and Burer. Chimera will be your most fearsome night encounter, as it moves rapidly, hiding in the dark, always trying to attack you from the rear; however it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be such a menace during day time, as it can be easily spotted under the sun light. The Burer uses telekinesis to grab and throw objects at you, which can be a heavy barrel or even your own weapon pulled out of your hands and thrown at you. It was also mentioned in some previews that Burer is able to cast a bulletproof shield with his telekinetic abilities. But the good thing about Bruer is that he is not really an aggressive creature and, for the most part, will only attack if the player bothers him. The behavior of the older and more familiar mutants been reworked as well. For example, dogs and snorks are now attacking on the move, instead of just stopping in front of you and biting like before; so fighting them is now much harder, especially when they attack in packs. The packs, however, can now be formed with the mutants of each type, and since all the mutants are now divided into carnivores and herbivores, we can expect one hunting the other. The Bloodsucker has been redone as well, so it can now literally grab the player and start sucking the blood out of him. If you think they now have an unfair advantage over you, the developers made it fair by removing the invincibility of the bloodsucker while he is invisible. The stalkers, as mentioned before, have a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½timetableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of what to do during the day: they leave the base in the morning, alone or as a small group, roaming across the landscape in search of artifacts and finally return to the base in the evening for some rest. The developers are promising to make a fair system of an artifact trade, so if you happen to run across some stalker, you can see the stuff he has already collected and trade with him by offering something more worthy than just vodka or a lump of bread. Searching for an artifact with the detector is also in the game, and both positive and negative effects of the artifacts are rebalanced.
