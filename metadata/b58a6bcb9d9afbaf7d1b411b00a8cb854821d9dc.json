It's songs from the new album live sorted in the order as the new album sorted 'em.\nTorrent for the entire live show can be found here:\nhttp://torrent.genesis-movement.org/torrents-details.php?id=4088\n\nIf you, like me, are waiting for the original new album to be shipped to your mailbox this is a nice thing to hold you over.\n\nIf you here these songs in this torrent and wonder what the original studio recording would sound like. Both digital and physical album can be bought here:\nhttp://www.hackettsongshop.co.uk/\n\nSince this is songs from genesis legal bootleg trading site I guess this torrent probably is legal as well, no piracy in this torrent.\nAnd of course it's illegal to sell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58a6bcb9d9afbaf7d1b411b00a8cb854821d9dc","amp;dn":"Steve+Hackett+-+Out+of+the+Tunnel%5C%27s+Mouth+%28Kind+of%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58a6bcb9d9afbaf7d1b411b00a8cb854821d9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,138,107,203,157,154,251,175,125,27,65,27,0,168,203,133,72,33,217,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
