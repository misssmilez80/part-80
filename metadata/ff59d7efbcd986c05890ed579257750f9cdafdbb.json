It provides comprehensive coverage of the e-government issues faced by managers, consultants and other practitioners.\n\nRichard Heeks draws on international examples to guide readers through crucial e-government management issues such as the management of strategy and projects; data security; quality; people, money and policies, and dealing with political and ethical challenges. The second part of the book focuses on the implementation of e-government systems. It explores activities such as: feasibility studies, system analysis, system design, construction and marketing.\n\nInstructive diagrams, synoptic models and case studies underpin the book's content while class and practitioner assessments will help readers monitor their understanding. Additional material is also available on a companion Website.\n\nThis book will be welcomed by students pursuing an MPA, undergraduates studying public policy and administration, and practitioners on government in-service training.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Managing-eGovernment-International-Text/dp/0761967923&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Managing-eGovernment-International-Text/dp/0761967923&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff59d7efbcd986c05890ed579257750f9cdafdbb","amp;dn":"Implementing+%26+Managing+Government.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff59d7efbcd986c05890ed579257750f9cdafdbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,89,215,239,188,217,134,192,88,144,237,87,146,87,117,15,156,218,253,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
