When I found out there was a Director's Cut, I was dismayed and conflicted.  I really love the film, but I hate buying &quot;duplicate&quot; DVDs (though that makes easy Christmas for the ladies in my life).\n\nSo, I turned to ye olde Intarweb, but was unable to find a copy of the Director's Cut (except for one members-only DVD ISO site that I was not a member of).  Finally, I broke down and bought a used copy of The Director's Cut and decided to save all of the rest of you from similar dilemmas.\n\nSo, here it is.  I don't know yet whether I prefer the Director's Cut over the original.  The original flows a bit better, especially with the amazing soundtrack.  It's a real shame to have to doctor Salif Keita or the Sam Cooke cover during the intro.  You can make up your own minds.  Maybe some day a &quot;Final Cut&quot; will come out.\n\nI would recommend picking one of the versions and buying a retail DVD or BD copy for the full experience.\n\nI have included the &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary.  It's pretty good as these things go.\n\n\n\nTitle: Ali\n\nAudio: English 5.1 (Encoded in Stereo VBR MP3 w/Dolby Surround)\n       English 2.0 (Commentary, Stereo VBR MP3)\n\nVideo: 640x272 XVID\n\nSubtitles: English\n           EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\n           FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais\n           (All external)\n\n\nFree Pimp C!\nC The Pimp Free At Last!\nChad Butler (1973-2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65ca67c7b0ea0f5958af0646549027318fb2c9af","amp;dn":"Ali+-+The+Director%5C%27s+Cut+%2B+Making+Of%5B2001%5D%5BEnglish%5D%5BEn-Es-Fr-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65ca67c7b0ea0f5958af0646549027318fb2c9af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,202,103,199,176,234,15,89,88,175,6,70,84,144,39,49,143,178,201,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
