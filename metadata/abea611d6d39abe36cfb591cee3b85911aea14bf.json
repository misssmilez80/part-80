We scoured several continents to find\nthe best and most ass kicking bands to pay homage to the greatest decade that\nrock and roll has ever known.\n\nLet's get this straight right up front, these aren't covers. We sifted through a\nlot of bands simply covering their favorite jams and you won't find any of them\nhere. In the end we cut this baby off with 31 tracks and a waiting list a mile\nlong to get in. What you will find on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSucking the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are some of the best\nand most true to life rawk bands of the 21st century lovingly re-working,\nre-interpreting, and in some cases re-defining the music that first inspired\nthem to make music in the first place.\n\nFrom the ferocious opening blast of Sasquatch's incredible revamping of Grand\nFunk Railroad's classic &quot;Are You Ready&quot; through the final breaths of Valis'\npsychedelic re-invention of Gary Wright's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDream WeaverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSucking the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is\na rollercoaster ride through the classics that defined a decade. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an aural\ntrip down memory lane back to the good old days when Rock &amp; Roll actually stood\nfor something. These two discs feature Small Stone alumni both past and present\nas well as some of our favorite acts ever. And whatever you do donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t miss out on\nthe incredible first ever recordings of Five Horse Johnson with Clutch. It is\nunbelieveable.\n\nSo, break out your lava lamps and lay some carpet down in the back of your SUV\nbecause the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s are back with a vengeance. This is an incredibly limited\npressing and when itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gone itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gone, so youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d better get it while you can.\nOperators are standing by. Eight track version not available. Stairway not\nincluded. Void in Kansas, Chicago &amp; where ever the hell the Bay City Roller's\nare from.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abea611d6d39abe36cfb591cee3b85911aea14bf","amp;dn":"VA-Sucking_The_70s-Back_In_The_Saddle_Again-2CD-2007-SDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abea611d6d39abe36cfb591cee3b85911aea14bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,234,97,29,109,57,171,227,108,251,89,28,238,59,133,145,26,234,20,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
