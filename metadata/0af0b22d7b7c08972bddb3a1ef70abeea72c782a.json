With 3ds Max 2010 software, professionals in the game \ndevelopment, television, film, and digital publishing industries will find the \ntoolsets they need for a comprehensive 3D modeling and 3D animation solution \nright out of the box.\n[list]\nData and Scene Management \nModeling \nPolygon Modeling and Texturing \nSpline/Extended Spline Modeling \nGeneral Animation \nCharacter Animation \nModifiers \nSpace Warps \nDynamics \nCloth \nParticles \nMultiple Rendering Options \nRendering Controls and Effects \nHair and Fur \nProSound \nMAXScript \n3ds Max API/SDK \nConnectivity and Integration[/list]\n\n[b]WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New [/b]\nThe award-winning AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 3ds MaxÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® software is the tool of choice for leaders \nin the game development, television, film, and digital publishing industries \nwho want a comprehensive 3D modeling, animation, and rendering solution right \nout of the box. \nNow, Autodesk 3ds Max 2010 builds on this success with powerful new toolsets to \nhelp you shape your worlds the way you want, manage complex scenes with ease, \nand take advantage of unprecedented support for software interoperability and \npipeline integration.\n\n[b]Integrated mental mill Technology[/b]\nDevelop, test, and maintain powerful mental millÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® shaders and shader \ngraphs?right inside 3ds Max. As the first 3D modeling and animation program to \nintegrate mental mill technology, 3ds Max 2010 gives you real-time visual \nfeedback, enabling even the novice user to create sophisticated, \nhardware-agnostic shaders.\n\n[b]PFlowAdvanced Particle Effects[/b]\nIncorporate sophisticated particle effects into your 3ds Max scenes with \nPFlowAdvanced, a toolset of 12 new operators including precision painting, for \nmanually specifying where particles will emit; and Shape Plus, an enhanced \nselection of 2D and 3D shapes. PFlowAdvanced also includes a range of utilities \nand grouping operators, and the PFlowElements library with over 100 element \nsamples created by leaders in the 3D effects industry.\n\n[b]Containers[/b]\nThe new Containers toolset in 3ds Max facilitates collaboration and flexible \nworkflows by enabling users to collect multiple objects of a complex scene into \na single container. Place related objects?such as sections of a city?in a \ncontainer and treat them as a single element. To improve scene performance, \ntemporarily unload containers from the viewport display while maintaining their \nrelationships to the scene and reload later when needed?saving memory, \nincreasing viewport performance, and decreasing load and save times. Translate, \ndelete, copy, or save container nodes; use containers to override object \nproperties for scene organization without affecting layer organization (similar \nto a nested layer workflow); and reference multiple containers created by \nothers into a single scene so users can work together in context. Users can \naccess and edit each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s container, allowing flexible workflows while also \nimposing constraints on what can be edited.\n\n[b]xView Mesh Analyzer[/b]\nReduce errors in your pipeline with the new xView mesh analyzer technology, a \npowerful tool with live in-viewport reporting that helps you quickly and \nefficiently resolve mesh errors, such as overlapping UVs, duplicate faces, and \nisolated vertices. The xView analyzer speeds the testing of models and maps, \nand lets you add your own specific tests and queries.\n\n[b]OBJ Import [/b]\nEasily import and export 3D model data between 3ds Max and AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MudboxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ \nsoftware?as well as other third-party 3D digital sculpting applications?with \nimproved OBJ plug-in performance and expanded file-format support. Enhanced \nfeatures enable you to view OBJ files for texture coordinates and smoothing \ngroups, and choose from options for importing normals, triangulating polygons \non import, and saving normal and polygon import presets for future use.\n\n[b]ProOptimizer[/b]\nQuickly and intelligently optimize your high-poly-count 3D models. ProOptimizer \nenables you to precisely control the number of faces or points in your scene or \nmodel by removing useful faces last to reduce a selection up to 75 percent \nwithout loss of detail. Scenes can be optimized in real time or batch \noptimized. ProOptimizer technology maintains all UV-texture-channel and \nvertex-color-channel information, respects the symmetry of models, preserves \nexplicit normals, and gives you the option to protect or exclude object \nborders.\n\n[b]ProSound[/b]\nSync your audio playback with the viewport and render your track to match the \nplayback speed with the new ProSound multitrack audio system. Add up to 100 \naudio tracks to your scene and animate the volume of each track; the technology \nalso supports both PCM and compressed audio in AVI and WAV format with up to \nsix output channels.\n\n[b]Performance Improvements[/b]\nWork more efficiently with expanded multiprocessor support. Mesh-display \nprocessing algorithms and analytical calculations performed by the new xView \nmesh analyzer have been multithreaded for increased productivity. These \nimprovements build on the many graphical processing unit (GPU) optimizations of \nearlier 3ds Max versions to give users a much more responsive viewport \nexperience.\n\n[b]C# and .NET Support[/b]\nCustomize, extend, and integrate 3ds Max 2010 into your existing pipelines with \nimproved support for C# and .NET; a new MAXScript debugger with line-number \nsupport helps identify problems in customized scripts. \n\n[b]Installation[/b]\nBurn to dvd\nSee installation note in Keygen folder\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]Note[/b] this torrent contains keygens and tested and used by me and is clean\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af0b22d7b7c08972bddb3a1ef70abeea72c782a","amp;dn":"Autodesk+3dsMax2010+%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsuperl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af0b22d7b7c08972bddb3a1ef70abeea72c782a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,240,178,45,123,124,8,151,43,221,179,161,239,112,171,238,167,44,120,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
