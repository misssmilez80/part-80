Larsson's DetErMine Records distributes the band's albums in Sweden, while they are signed to Eyeball Records in the United States. The Tiny's first album, Close Enough, was released in Spring 2004 in Sweden, and a year later in the United States. Their second album, Starring: Someone Like You, was released in mid-2006.\n\nThe group's hauntingly minimalistic music demonstrates classical, gothic, and other influences. Larsson's characteristically childlike singing voice is frequently prone to melodic yowling and warbling, and has drawn comparisons to BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk and Kate Bush.\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2009 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b043eed7b4e3c6313a54b552b5496a146250275e","amp;dn":"The+Tiny+-+The+Man+Who+Ran+%28Live+Sverige%21+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b043eed7b4e3c6313a54b552b5496a146250275e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,67,238,215,180,227,198,49,58,84,181,82,181,73,106,20,98,80,39,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
