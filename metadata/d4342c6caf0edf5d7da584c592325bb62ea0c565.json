The search for planets beyond the solar system which are like our planet Earth.\n\nThe program follows leading astronomers embarking on an exciting visual journey using CGI animation, to explore strange worlds that seem like figments of imagination. Planets with iron rain and hot ice? Planets with diamonds everywhere? Planets with endless oceans of gas?\n\nAs the National Geographic reveal it gets even stranger still. Imagine planets with abnormal orbital patterns and planets with no pattern at all that drift alone in the Milky Way. There are even planets, called planemos, that have, in essence, been kicked out of their solar system. Some are so bizarre scientists could never have predicted their existence nor their characteristics. Naturally it begs the question: could life exist on these planets?\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 399 MiB for 47mn 13s 608ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Science/Nature\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 038 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 368 (1.652) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4342c6caf0edf5d7da584c592325bb62ea0c565","amp;dn":"National+Geographic-Alien+Worlds+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4342c6caf0edf5d7da584c592325bb62ea0c565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,52,44,108,175,14,223,93,125,165,132,197,146,50,91,182,46,160,197,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
