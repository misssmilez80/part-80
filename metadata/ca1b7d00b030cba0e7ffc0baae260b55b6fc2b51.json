Most peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reaction is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat kind of name is that for a band?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Actually, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just one example of how different and complex the Kansas City, Missouri based band can be. When trying to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiscoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a name for the band in mid 2005, the first bass player John Foster spoke up and replied ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow About The Truth?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s when the band realized that the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was not only a good name for the band, but is what everyone really wants, not deception or lies. This became the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s philosophy in dealing with their music as well as pertaining to their personal lives as well.\n\nHow About The Truth consists of Ricky Horney (25) from Camden Point, Missouri on Lead Vocals &amp; Didgeridoo, Pat Kelley (19) Kansas City, Missouri playing Lead Guitar, Bryant Bridges (20) Smithville, Missouri on Vocals, Piano, and Rhythm Guitar, Ricky Sands (19) Agency, Missouri on Bass, with Matt Davis (19) Kansas City, Missouri playing Drums and Percussion.\n\nWhen asked to describe the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical style, that can difficult at times. The reason being, HattÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music cannot easily be put into a certain genre because the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style is an ongoing work in progress. The band is always open to new ideas with one example being, the use of the Aborigine Didgeridoo used in the intros on some of their songs. Melodic at its core, the band agrees its music has gotten heavier in the last several years. The closest industry classification would probably be Progressive/Alternative Rock with a Post-Grunge influence.\n\nHow About The Truth writes and composes all of its own songs and music. Three independent CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s have been released. Around The Table, Eleven To Elm, and Redefine (EP). The Redefine (EP) was recorded, mixed, and mastered at Chapman Recording Studio of Lenexa, Kansas.\n\nFor more info visit:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1b7d00b030cba0e7ffc0baae260b55b6fc2b51","amp;dn":"How+About+The+Truth%3F+-+Redefine+%28EP%29+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1b7d00b030cba0e7ffc0baae260b55b6fc2b51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,27,125,0,176,48,203,160,231,255,192,186,174,38,11,85,182,252,43,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
