In direct, straightforward, and at times strikingly lyrical prose, Jamison looks back at her relationship with her husband, Richard Wyatt, a renowned scientist who battled debilitating dyslexia to become one of the foremost experts on schizophrenia. And with her characteristic honesty, candor, wit, and simplicity, she describes his death, her own long, difficult struggle with grief, and her efforts to distinguish grief from depression.\n\nBut she also recalls the great joy that Richard brought her during the nearly twenty years they had together. Wryly humorous anecdotes mingle with bittersweet memories of a relationship that was passionate and lovingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if troubled on occasion by her manic-depressive (bipolar) illnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as Jamison reveals the ways in which her husband encouraged her to write openly about her mental illness and, through his courage and grace taught her to live fully.\n\nA penetrating psychological study of grief viewed from deep inside the experience itself, Nothing Was the Same is also a deeply moving memoir by a superb writer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d8ce1b19ab724f0a4d3bb981f46a12d10a1285","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+%5B2009%5D+Nothing+Was+the+Same","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d8ce1b19ab724f0a4d3bb981f46a12d10a1285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,216,206,27,25,171,114,79,10,77,59,185,129,244,106,18,209,10,18,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
