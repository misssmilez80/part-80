This is a replacement for the old QuickView utility, but much more powerful due to its plug-in architecture. \nYou can access CobView when you right click any file or folder on your computer. The program analyzes the file extension and starts the right plug-in to view the file. \nSome standard plug-ins show, for example, text files with syntax highlighting (Pascal, c++, java, html, etc), the exported and imported functions of a dll or exe file, the ID3 tags of a mp3 file, and many more... \n\n\n\n*****Creating CobView plugins*****\n\nIf you are a developer, you may want to create your own plug-in. If you create a cool plug-in and want to publish it, please, send it to me to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6f0c000d060e012f0a0b1a0c411a021a411c0a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and I will put it on the program's site. \n\nI am NOT responsible for any 3rd parts plug-in. You, as the plug-in author are the responsible for your plug-in functionality and support.\n\nHow does it work? \nCobView is a shell extension in the form of a context menu that shows when the user right clicks on any file or folder on Windows Explorer. When the user clicks on CobView, the following actions happen:  \n\n*The program CobView.exe is loaded.   \n*This program search the registry on the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARECobianCobViewExt where the associations are stored.   \n*If the extension of the selected file is found there, the associated plugin is called and the file name is passed to it.   \n*If the extension is NOT found on the registry, the CobGeneral.dll plugin is called then. \nImage)\nAs a plug-in developer you can create your plug-ins in any language you want. \n\nA plug-in MUST have 2 exported procedures with a fixed format. \n\nAll other procedures and functions are free. You can download a plug-in example here.\n\n The two obligatory procedures that must be present on a plug-in are: \n\nprocedure RegisterExt;stdcall; \n\nprocedure ShowInfo(FileName:PChar);stdcall; \n\nThe first procedure is used to register the extensions by the program CobReg.exe. An example in Delphi of what this procedure may do is: \n\nprocedure RegisterExt;stdcall; \nvar   \nReg:TRegistry;   \nDllName:array[0..MAX_PATH] of char;   \nDll:string; \nbegin    \n//Register the extensions that the DLL handles\n    Reg:=TRegistry.Create();\n    try\n      Reg.RootKey:=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE;\n      if Reg.OpenKey ('SoftWareCobianCobViewExt',true) then\n        begin\n          GetModuleFileName(hInstance,DllName,SIzeOf(DllName));\n          Dll:=ExtractFileName(String(DllName));\n          Reg.WriteString('.ex1',Dll);\n          Reg.WriteString('.ex2',Dll);\n       end;\n   finally\n     Reg.Free;\n   end;\n end; \n\nIn this example, the program will register the extensions ex1 and ex2 to be open with your plug-in. \n\n The second procedure will receive the file name as a PChar and it is up to you what to do with this file name. I recommend you to download the sample program from my site. \n\nSome guidelines: \n\n*Your plug-in may include a readme file with your Copyright and other legal information. (for example that YOU are the responsible for your plug-in as the author) \n*If you store some configuration keys on the registry, please use the key HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareCobianCobViewPluginsYourPlugin where YourPlugin is your plug-in name. *See the Delphi example on my site. \n*You can provide your own about box, but you can use my standard box for plug-ins by passing to it your own information. See again the Delphi example. \n\n                           Happy programming! \n   \n\n\nInstallation \nUnpack and run CobViewInstall.exe\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/cobview.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/cobview.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n      \n\n\n                            !!!!!!!!!!ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:864d9eb7165f7ce6d2ff7af204f80f9660cfbabe","amp;dn":"CobView+1.0.013+%5Bh33t%5D+%5Bpmsyb%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"864d9eb7165f7ce6d2ff7af204f80f9660cfbabe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,77,158,183,22,95,124,230,210,255,122,242,4,248,15,150,96,207,186,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
