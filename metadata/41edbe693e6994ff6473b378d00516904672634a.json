Due to the underwhelming performance of Driv3r, particularly the often-derided on-foot sections, Parallel Lines returns to the formula used in earlier games in the series, focusing on driving, although shooting remains in the game. The game was received better by critics than the last game, though did receive some criticism.This is the first game of the Driver series that does not follow undercover cop Tanner.\nGameplay\n\nDriver: Parallel Lines takes place in an entirely open world environment. Instead of choosing minigames from a menu as in previous Driver titles, minigames are now accessed from the in-game world. Many changes have been made from the previous game, including visible blood when someone is shot, a money system, fully modifiable vehicles, environment destruction (i.e., lamp posts can now be run over and fire hydrants can break, spewing water into the air), and a new felony system that differentiates between personal felony and felony &quot;attached&quot; to vehicles the player has used. If the player attracts police attention on foot or in a certain vehicle and then loses the police and enters a &quot;clean&quot; car, their wanted level will be suspended. It can be reactivated, though, by spending too much time in the sight of a police officer, who will eventually recognize the player as &quot;wanted&quot;. The same principle applies to out-of-car activities, such as weapon use, and allows the player to holster a weapon in order to lose police attention until spotted committing illegal acts again. For the Wii version, the felony bar has been replaced with Grand Theft Auto-esque &quot;stars&quot; which light up when the player attracts police attention. Also, swimming and jumping abilities from Driv3r, were removed.\n\nThe game was originally intended to include online multiplayer, but this was scrapped when it became apparent to the developers that they could not deliver a strong multiplayer mode[5] and wanted to focus entirely on the single-player portion of the game. The instant replay film director mode of previous Driver games was removed from Parallel Lines. Instead, the only available cinematic mode is the fixed-perspective slow-motion &quot;Thrill Camera&quot;.\nNew York City\nThe major features of New York's skyline, such as the Empire State Building, are always visible, even from the other boroughs across the river.\n\nThe interpretation of New York City in Parallel Lines is not GPS street-accurate like True Crime: New York City's Manhattan. Instead, the game presents a smaller but more stylistic version of the city that includes all the boroughs except Staten Island and parts of the New Jersey shore. The game's Manhattan, Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and New Jersey consists of 222.5 miles (358.1 km) of roadway, larger than the combined total of all three cities (Miami, Nice, and Istanbul) from Driv3r. The game's New York City is also more &quot;life-like&quot; compared to previous games in the series: vendors sell donuts, NPC pedestrians talk rather than simply grunting and screaming, and numerous side jobs (such as taxi driving and car towing) are available. Several things have changed in the game from real-life New York, for example, New York Police Department has simply been dubbed into &quot;City Police&quot;. However, the game completely lacks any kind of weather. The only atmospheric changes are the day-to-night cycle.\n\nIn 1978, the World Trade Center complex is present, along with New York City's many other landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, Times Square, Central Park and the Flatiron Building, in both 1978 and 2006. Furthermore, despite not being built until the 1980s, the World Financial Center is present in both eras opposite the World Trade Center. In Brooklyn, the player can visit Coney Island. Downtown Brooklyn is also present but not accurate to its real-life counter part. The game features all of New York City's major bridges except the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Whitestone Bridge, the Hell Gate Bridge, and the Throgs Neck Bridge. The player can traverse these bridges freely from the start. An elevated portion of the New York City Subway that runs from Manhattan to Coney Island is part of the game world, but the subway system is not accessible to the player as a means of transportation; although trains do run on the above ground railway system.\nVehicles\n\nBoth eras included in the game have distinct styles of vehicles, although a few of the 1978-era cars do show up in 2006, and the cars from 2006 can show up in 1978 by using the all cars cheat code, however all cars in from 1978 are all accessible in shop in 2006. Although based on real automobiles, all vehicles in the game are fictitious, and are given fictitious names.\n\nNew to the Driver franchise is the ability to customize, or mod, the player's vehicle. Each vehicle can be upgraded numerous ways in Ray's Garage. Upgrades include custom body and paint jobs, although they are preset, increased engine power, nitrous boosters, bulletproof glass, window film and tunable springs, shocks, ride height, brakes, neon lighting, and downforce. A test track is available to &quot;try out&quot; the upgraded vehicles and making any necessary adjustments.But the upgrades are 10x more expensive in the new era.\nStory\n\nThe game follows 18-year-old TK, coincidentally referred to as &quot;The Kid&quot;, who works as a getaway driver for a New York crime ring in 1978. His childhood friend Ray introduces him to Slink, whom he does low-level work for. He is then introduced to two other prominent gangsters, &quot;The Mexican&quot; and Bishop. Bishop hatches a plan to break an associate, Candy, out of Rikers Island Prison, which TK successfully carries out.\n\nThe gangsters form a collective, composed of TK, Slink, Bishop, The Mexican and Candy and led by a corrupt undercover detective, Corrigan. Corrigan's organization wishes to start distributing cocaine in New York City, but a prominent Colombian drug lord Rafael Martinez already has a foothold, so Corrigan plans to have Martinez kidnapped. After Martinez's kidnap and receipt of his ransom money, Corrigan changes the plan and shoots Martinez dead. Figuring that TK is insignificant, Corrigan shoots him at the same time and leaves him to be framed and charged with kidnap and murder. TK is sentenced to 28 years at Sing-Sing.\n\nWhile at Sing-Sing, TK plans vengeance upon each of the men who betrayed him. He is released in 2006 aged 46 and, with Ray's help, immediately tracks down and kills The Mexican, now a lowly alcoholic hoodrat who works at an arcade. His corpse is thrown out onto the street from TK's car, in front of Corrigan, now the Commissioner of the NYPD, who immediately recognizes him. Afterwards, he meets Maria, an ally of Candy, who is now a wealthy and prominent gangster. TK does jobs for Maria in the hope of reaching him.\n\nAfter destroying Slink's pornography and drugs outlets, TK kills Slink in a car-chase. For Bishop, who is now a drugs kingpin, TK disrupts his smuggling operation. Bishop phones TK and offers him a chance to duel one-on-one, but turns up in an army tank armed with explosives. TK succeeds in blowing up the tank and killing Bishop. While on a job for Maria, TK finally gets to meet Candy, but he is quickly apprehended by Candy's henchmen and drugged. TK manages to break free however and kills Candy in a car-chase.\n\nCorrigan then turns up at Ray's garage in Hunt's Point. He reveals that Ray has been working for him, to help TK inadvertently erase all of Corrigan's connections to the 1978 kidnapping, in exchange for money. Corrigan then kills Ray and tries to shoot TK, but TK is saved by Maria who turns up armed. Corrigan escapes and Maria reveals she is actually the daughter of Rafael Martinez, the man Corrigan killed in 1978.\n\nThey put a Cop Car with Candy's body in his parking space, blow up his office, Put Slink's body in the trunk of his limo and kill his body guards (Who tried to kill TK before, once with a car bomb in front of Ray's, another with an ambush at the start of Ram Raider. Another ambush for a job with Maria, and when TK tried to escape with Bishop's shipment of rocket launchers.) Maria tells TK that Corrigan is in Witness Protection. TK kills more bodyguards but Corrigan escapes by helicopter. After blowing up a tunnel with TK in it (TK narrowly escaping) he shoots down the chopper. Corrigan survives, but after a while he gives Corrigan to Maria, who wants more revenge than TK.\n\nIn order for this game to run properly, your PC MUST meet or exceed these minimum system requirements:\nSupported OS: Windows XP (w/ SP1 or higher) / Vista (only)\nProcessor: 2 GHz Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon or better (3.4 GHz Pentium IV or AMD Athlon or better recommended)\nRAM: 256 MB (512 MB recommended)\nVideo Card: 64 MB DirectX 9.0c w/ shader 1.1 compliance (128 MB w/ shader 2.0 recommended) (see supported list*)\nSound Card: DirectX 9-compliant sound card\nDirectX Version: DirectX 9.0c or higher (included on disc)\nDVD-ROM: 4x or faster DVD-ROM drive\nHard Drive Space: 4.8 GB free space\nPeripherals Supported: Windows-compatible keyboard and mouse, Xbox 360 Controller for Windows\nMultiplayer: None\n\n*Supported Video Cards:\nNVIDIA GeForce 3 / 4 / FX / 7 series (Geforce 4MX NOT supported)\nATI Radeon 8500 / 9000 / X series\n\nLaptop versions of these cards are not fully supported.\n\nInstallation \n1: Burn or mount the ISO\n2: Install by running setup or autorun\n3: copy the crack to where you installed and overwrite the new .exe\n4: Done\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41edbe693e6994ff6473b378d00516904672634a","amp;dn":"Driver-Parallel+Lines%28Full+Install%29tim225","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41edbe693e6994ff6473b378d00516904672634a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,237,190,105,62,105,148,255,100,115,179,120,208,5,22,144,70,114,99,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
