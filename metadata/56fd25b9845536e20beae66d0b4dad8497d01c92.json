Lee Ermey  [01x13]  Bunker Busters  (HDTV 720p)  \n\n\nOriginal Airdate:  Friday November 13th, 2009\n\n\nIn days of old, if your army had to take on a huge stone \ncastle, there was only one option: bunker busting siege \nweapons like the giant crossbow known as the Ballista \nand the fearsome Trebuchet! These weapons hurled rocks \nand flaming kegs to cause mayhem and smash through \nwalls. Today the siege tradition continues, with our \nmilitary using high-explosives to blow the bad guys \nout of their foxholes. First, Gunny let's loose massive \nboulders from an ancient trebuchet catapult against an \nenemy castle. Then he gets his hands on some old-style \ngunpowder and recreates the big bangs that were used \nto bring down enemy bunkers, all the time instructed by \ncommitted experts who revel in the history of these amazing \nweapons. Gunny also visits today's bunker busters--military \nengineers who bust under, over, and into enemy strongholds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56fd25b9845536e20beae66d0b4dad8497d01c92","amp;dn":"Lock.N.Load.S01E13.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56fd25b9845536e20beae66d0b4dad8497d01c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,253,37,185,132,85,54,226,11,234,230,109,11,77,173,132,151,208,28,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
