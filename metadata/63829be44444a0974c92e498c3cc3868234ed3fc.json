Jarre performed new 90 minute live performances of OxygÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne, complete with new tracks, using only vintage synthesizers and assisted on stage by French musicians Francis Rimbert, Claude Samard and Dominique Perrier.\n\nIn 2008, The Mail on Sunday newspaper distributed more than 2 million copies of the OxygÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne 30th Anniversary CD to its readers in the United Kingdom. In 2008, Francis Dreyfus Music said it intended to bring legal actions against The Mail on Sunday and EMI, based on the claim that the contents of the CD do not come from a new re-recorded master, but are from the original master to which the French label owns the rights.[1]\n\n\n\n\nLive In Your Living Room Stereoscopic 3D DVD\n\nLimited edition only (plus two pairs of 3D glasses)\n\n   1. &quot;Prelude&quot; (New Track)\n   2. &quot;Oxygene Part I&quot;\n   3. &quot;Oxygene Part II&quot;\n   4. &quot;Oxygene Part III&quot;\n   5. &quot;Variation Part I&quot; (New track)\n   6. &quot;Oxygene Part IV&quot;\n   7. &quot;Variation Part II&quot; (New track)\n   8. &quot;Oxygene Part V&quot;\n   9. &quot;Variation Part III&quot; (New track)\n  10. &quot;Oxygene Part VI&quot;\n\n    * + The Making Of\n    * + Instruments Presentation\n    * + 3D gallery\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63829be44444a0974c92e498c3cc3868234ed3fc","amp;dn":"Oxygene.3D.+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Live+In+Your+Living+Room+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63829be44444a0974c92e498c3cc3868234ed3fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,130,155,228,68,68,160,151,76,146,228,152,195,204,56,104,35,78,211,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
