This is more \\&quot;sound architecture\\&quot; than \\&quot;music\\&quot;, the sounds are non-linear, three-dimensional, sometimes taking you on a journey to parts unknown, sometimes leaving you stationary but building a complete environment around you. Very highly recommended. \n\nMp3 VBR\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ab4ad0ad453f82955be0a600fe8ec1e12f1ea7","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-++Throne+Of+Drones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ab4ad0ad453f82955be0a600fe8ec1e12f1ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,171,74,208,173,69,63,130,149,91,224,166,0,254,142,193,225,47,30,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
