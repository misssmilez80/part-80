It went on to become the best selling Australian single of the year, achieving gold status in eleven weeks, and remaining at #1 on the national charts for a (then) record ten weeks.[1][2] &quot;Eagle Rock&quot; also spent 17 weeks at the #1 spot on the Melbourne Top 40 Singles Chart.[3] The song was re-released by Wizard Records in 1982, and reached #17 on the Australian singles charts.\n\nGuitarist, vocalist and the song's writer Ross Wilson was living and performing in London England when he wrote the song. He explained his inspiration for the song:\n\nIt came from a Sunday Times liftout magazine A-Z on music. In the before blues section there was an evocative photo of rural black Americans dancing in a dirt poor juke joint - the caption was along the lines of &quot;some negroes 'cut the pigeon wing' and 'do the eagle rock'&quot;.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ross Wilson , 2001\n&quot;Eagle Rock&quot; was a popular 1920s black dance performed with the arms outstretched and the body rocking from side to side, 'Doing the eagle rock' is also a metaphor for sexual intercourse.\n\nThe accompanying promotional video, directed by Chris LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶fvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n, was &quot;put together quickly for $300 and shows the band in some old Melbourne haunts including the Dolphin CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in Clarendon St., South Melbourne, St. Kilda's Aussie Burger Bar opposite Luna Park and live shots from the 1971 Myponga Festival held in South Australia.&quot;\nIn May 2001, Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary by naming the Best Australian Songs of all time, as decided by a 100 strong industry panel, &quot;Eagle Rock&quot; was declared second behind the Easybeats' &quot;Friday On My Mind&quot;.\n\n\nThe song was covered by the Australian children's group The Wiggles on their 2003 tour, with Captain Feathersword singing lead. It appears on the DVD &quot;Live Hot Potatoes.&quot;\n\n\nCGI Version","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c10437ff7d84415093f73c4140684debda930088","amp;dn":"The+Wiggles+-+Eagle+Rock.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c10437ff7d84415093f73c4140684debda930088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,4,55,255,125,132,65,80,147,247,60,65,64,104,77,235,218,147,0,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
