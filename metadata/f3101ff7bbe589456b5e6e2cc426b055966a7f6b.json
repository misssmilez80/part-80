Shocked that someone else is drawing the same conclusions,    \n   Darwin knows that he must publish his own work post haste. Hooker     \n       helps to ensure that Darwin has priority over Wallace, by         \n       arranging a joint reading of their theories, whilst Huxley        \n   sharpens his beak and claws in readiness to defend Darwin against     \n      the Church and scientific establishment; Wallace returns to        \n   England and immediately joins battle in defence of Darwin. On the     \n   Origin of Species is published to acclaim and attack and Darwin's     \n    allies embark on a bitter and brutal public battle for Darwin's      \n     idea and the future of science. The battle culminates with the      \n    legendary Oxford debate in which Hooker and Huxley go toe-to-toe     \n        with the reactionary forces of Church and the scientific         \n       establishment.

Shocked that someone else is drawing the same conclusions,    \n   Darwin knows that he must publish his own work post haste. Hooker     \n       helps to ensure that Darwin has priority over Wallace, by         \n       arranging a joint reading of their theories, whilst Huxley        \n   sharpens his beak and claws in readiness to defend Darwin against     \n      the Church and scientific establishment; Wallace returns to        \n   England and immediately joins battle in defence of Darwin.
