Trillian 5 introduces improved Facebook Chat via XMPP and support for Foursquare, LinkedIn, and studiVZ / meinVZ / schuelerVZ chat!\nWith a multitude of options and a comprehensive library of plugins, skins and skin packs, you can extend and customize Trillian in any way imaginable. Show RSS feeds or even play music while chugging along with a contact list right out of Terminator 5. Trillian is built directly in C++ using native Windows APIs. Not relying on third-party runtimes or toolkits means lower memory consumption and direct access to native Windows features as soon as they're made available to developers. Trillian 5 for Windows is the smoothest and fastest version of Trillian ever!\n\n\nInstall Notes: \n1. Install Trillian. (trillian-v5.0.0.33.exe) (Be careful and decline 3rd party softwares during install) !Do Not launch when install finishes!\n2. Copy/Paste patch.exe into installation directory and run it. (you can uncheck make backup if you like)\n\nOther Notes:\nIf you are new to Trillian you must register a new account. Upon opening Trillian for the first time, press Register for a new account and continue through the rest of signup with actual info.\n\nUploaders Notes: When using the latest patch with build 32, ads were still showing. It turns out that it was a problem with Build 32 and not the patcher. Enjoy build 33 with this awesome patcher that should work throughout the rest of Trillian 5. :)\n\n\n\nEnjoy! Upload anywhere else you like. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ce95fd701c94d435431ad98233799748367d2f","amp;dn":"Trillian+5.0+Build+33+Pro-LT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ce95fd701c94d435431ad98233799748367d2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,206,149,253,112,28,148,212,53,67,26,217,130,51,121,151,72,54,125,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
