Stephens), Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), joins forces with the evil sorceress Morgana le Fay (Alice Krige), betraying Merlin. Morgana mortally wounds Merlin before his other apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica Gorloisen (Monica Bellucci), can stop her. While Balthazar battles Horvath, Morgana prepares to kill Balthazar, but is stopped by Veronica, who absorbs MorganaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul into her own body. As Morgana tries to kill Veronica from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning Morgana and Veronica in the Grimhold, a magic prison in the shape of a nesting doll. Before dying, Merlin gives his remaining apprentice a dragon ring that will identify the Prime Merlinian, who will become Merlin's successor. Only the Prime Merlinian will be able to defeat Morgana. Throughout history Balthazar imprisons Morganians, sorcerers who try to release Morgana, including Horvath, into successive layers on the Grimhold while he searches for the successor. In 2000, 10-year-old Dave Stutler (Jake Cherry), encounters Balthazar in a Manhattans antique store, who is as youthful as when Merlin gave him the ring. Hoping he is the successor, Balthazar gives him the dragon ring, which comes alive and wraps itself around Dave's finger. Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing Horvath. While battling for possession of the Grimhold, Balthazar and Horvath are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese urn with a ten-year lock. Dave is humiliated when he is discovered by his teacher and classmates with his pants wet due to a vase that broke in his lap. There is no trace of the battle, so everyone believes Dave made it up. In 2010, Dave (Jay Baruchel) is a physics student at New York University and has made the reacquaintance of a childhood crush, Becky (Teresa Palmer). The mystical urn opens, releasing Horvath and Balthazar. Horvath finds Dave, who is the last person he remembers possessing the Grimhold. Dave threw the Grimhold away after the battle, so he has no idea where it is. When Dave cannot tell him, Horvath unleashes a pack of wolves. Balthazar rescues Dave, and they escape atop a steel eagle.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Comedy\n\nRelease date: 13 August 2010 (UK)\n\ncast\n\n* Nicolas Cage\n* Jay Baruchel\n* Alfred Molina\n* Monica Bellucci\n* Teresa Palmer\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: The Sorcerers Apprentice 2010 720p BRRip(multi-sub)\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1941.39 MiB\nDuration: 1h 49mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 489 Kbps\nSubtitles: Danish,English,French,Persian,Greek,Swedish,Spanish\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-05-15 12:18:20\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1924 08d04a4\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/27942339877511962703.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/27942339877511962703.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/80491972491704692848.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/80491972491704692848.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/91969074714953790063.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/91969074714953790063.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/82648147442215932015.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/82648147442215932015.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61153222777326461586.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61153222777326461586.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/55542336657253102173.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/55542336657253102173.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/03703061627091551787.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/03703061627091551787.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f31066dab90772f7ab70e1186257f2784688e7","amp;dn":"The+Sorcerers+Apprentice+2010+720p+BRRip%28multi-sub%29x264+acc+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f31066dab90772f7ab70e1186257f2784688e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,243,16,102,218,185,7,114,247,171,112,225,24,98,87,242,120,70,136,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
