Other bands the members were involved in over the years include Halomachine and Warface (Ohio).  They went on to form Onenemy with a new singer after their &quot;He Who Angers&quot; era singer left, but not before this singer laid down some vocals on a demo in 2008 on the songs that would eventually become Onenemy songs.  After this band imploded, Ton went through s short-lived reunion, doing some rough recording, but now the main members of Riphead have asked back the singer from the &quot;He Who Angers&quot; era and they are now called NATIONAL COLLAPSE.  Look for a demo uploaded soon.\n\nEnjoy this piece of metal obscura.  It was uploaded by the band themselves to spread the music that was never released in a widespread fashion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d7493fe14ab35126398870e0e7d0d2955957b2","amp;dn":"RIPHEAD+-+THRASHING+OHIO+DEATH+GRIND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d7493fe14ab35126398870e0e7d0d2955957b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,215,73,63,225,74,179,81,38,57,136,112,224,231,208,210,149,89,87,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
