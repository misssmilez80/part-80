In that time, there rises a magnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. Against the backdrop, love-stories entwine: Tom, the master builder, Aliena, the noblewoman, the sadistic Lord William, Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone work and Ellen, the woman from the forest who casts a curse. At once, this is a sensuous and enduring love story and an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age. Follett masterfully weaves these stories through political turmoil of 12th century England, creating a relevant and viable world for today's audience and for generations to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6dd55eefd676a570fb6c2141c40056fe9bdf25a","amp;dn":"The.Pillars.Of.The.Earth.S01E01-E4.HDTV.X264+With+Greek+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6dd55eefd676a570fb6c2141c40056fe9bdf25a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,221,85,238,253,103,106,87,15,182,194,20,28,64,5,111,233,189,242,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
