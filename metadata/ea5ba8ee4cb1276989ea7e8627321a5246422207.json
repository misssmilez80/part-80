In contrast to Halo' signature gregorian chant, there is no choral music in ODST, and no previous Halo themes make a return appearance. Two out of the game's three hours of music were packaged in a two-disc soundtrack released September 22. Due to ODST's shift to a new protagonist, O'Donnell wanted to create new music that was evocative of Halo but branched in a different direction. Because the game tells a &quot;human story, not a cyborg story&quot;, O'Donnell said, the score was more &quot;intimate and personal&quot;. For the Rookie's rain-slicked investigations, O'Donnell felt that a jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the noir atmosphere. Other characters did not have any themes written for them specifically, but rather became paired with motifs that suited them.\n\nO'Donnell began writing the game's music while Bungie was creating the game's announcement trailer. O'Donnell based the trailer music on a small segment from the first ODST piece he wrote, titled &quot;Rain&quot;. Salvatori joined the project in February 2009 and helped complete the music chores in two months. Once O'Donnell felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Seattle, finished arrangements and recorded live musicians. Most of the music was recorded during winter and spring 2009. Additional composition chores were handled by Bungie sound designer C. Paul Johnson and orchestrator Stan LePard. Orchestra sessions were handled by the Northwest Sinfonia at Studio X in Washington, who had also recorded the music for Halo 3.\n\nTracks:\n\n101 - Overture\n102 - The Rookie\n103 - More Than His Share\n104 - Deference For Darkness\n105 - The Menagerie\n106 - Asphalt And Ablution\n107 - Traffic Jam\n108 - Neon Night\n109 - The Office Of Naval Intelligence\n201 - Bits And Pieces\n202 - Skyline\n203 - No Stone Unturned\n204 - One Way Ride\n205 - The Light At The End\n206 - Data Hive\n207 - Special Delivery\n208 - Finale\n\nEnjoy, SvC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5ba8ee4cb1276989ea7e8627321a5246422207","amp;dn":"Halo+3%3A+ODST+Original+SoundTrack+%5B2009-mp3-vbr%5D+%5BSvC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5ba8ee4cb1276989ea7e8627321a5246422207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,91,168,238,76,177,39,105,137,234,126,134,39,50,26,82,70,66,34,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
