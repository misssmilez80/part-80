It does a fairly good job in providing a brief history, but the main strength of the collection simply comes from the music.   Featuring cuts from Lightnin' Hopkins, Howlin' Wolf, B.  B.   King, Slim Harpo, Junior Parker, Elmore James, Albert Collins, and many, many others, it's a quick and effective way to sample a variety of different blues styles.   For neophytes, Essential Blues does offer a splendid introduction to the genre.  \n\nIf you are just starting to collect blues recordings, then you would really enjoy this one.  It includes some very popular ones, like the tracks by Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and BB King, as well as many lesser known artists.  But it's all good, and the variety in style that you hear from track to track makes this a great CD to play over and over again.  It's a lot of blues for the money, if you can find it! ~ Patrick Madigan\n\nVA House of Blues: Essential Blues V2 Dsk 2 of 2\n01  Going Down - Freddie King\n02  I Ain't Drunk - Albert Collins\n03  These Things - Robert Cray\n04  Shake Your Moneymaker - Elmore James\n05  All Of Your Love - Magic Sam\n06  High Compression - James Cotton\n07  Help Me - Sonny Boy Williamson\n08  I Ain't Superstitious - Willie Dixon\n09  Wang Dang Doodle - Koko Taylor\n10  I Can't Quit You Baby - Otis Rush\n11  I Can't Be Satisfied - Muddy Waters\n12  I'm A King Bee - Slim Harpo\n13  Down The Road Apiece - Amos Milburn\n14  Blue Guitar - Earl Hooker\n15  Everyday I Have The Blues - B.
