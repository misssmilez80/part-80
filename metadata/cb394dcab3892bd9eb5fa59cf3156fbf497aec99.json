Initially dubbed Roundabout, the group was first assembled\nas a session band for ex-Searchers drummer Chris Curtis but quickly\nwent their own way, touring Scandinavia before beginning work on\ntheir debut LP, Shades of Deep Purple. The most pop-oriented\nrelease of their career, the album generated a Top Five American\nhit with its reading of Joe South's Hush but otherwise went\nunnoticed at home. The Book of Taliesyn followed (in the U.S. only)\nin 1969, again cracking the U.S. Top 40 with a cover of Neil\nDiamond's Kentucky Woman\n\nWith their self-titled third LP, Deep Purple's ambitions grew\nhowever; the songs reflecting a new complexity and density as\nLord's classically influenced keyboards assumed a much greater\nfocus. Soon after the album's release, their American label\nTetragrammaton folded, and with the dismissals of Evans and Simper\nthe band started fresh, recruiting singer Ian Gillan and bassist\nRoger Glover from the ranks of the pop group Episode Six\n\n/team FKK\n\n01 Burn 06:25\n02 Love Child 04:16\n03 Smoke On The Water 06:06\n04 You Keep On Moving 06:15\n05 Highway Star 06:48\n06 Interview with Jon Lord and Gleen Hughes 06:46\n(Jakarta, December 1975)\n07 Come Taste the Band Electronic Press Kit 18:36\n08 Introduction 02:44\n09 The Demise Of Deep Purple MK II 03:44\n10 The Birth Of MK III 06:07\n11 The Making Of Burn 04:39\n12 The California Jam 1974 05:53\n13 Stormbringer 03:31\n14 Sunbury Music Festival 1975 03:09\n15 Glenn Hughes Troubled Times 05:40\n16 Drugs Become An Issue 02:57\n17 Ritchie Blackmore Leaves The Band 01:55\n18 Tommy Bolin 03:09\n19 Come Taste The Band 05:43\n20 Drugs Become A Problem 09:27\n21 Glenn Hughes In Rehabilitation 02:01\n22 Mk IV On Tour 02:21\n23 Indonesian Nightmare 10:16\n24 Rising Over Japan 03:40\n25 The Final MK IV shows 03:38\n26 Credits 01:05\n136:51 min\n\ngreetings to everyone supporting us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb394dcab3892bd9eb5fa59cf3156fbf497aec99","amp;dn":"Deep_Purple_-_Phoenix_Rising-DVD-2011-FKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb394dcab3892bd9eb5fa59cf3156fbf497aec99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,57,77,202,179,137,43,217,235,95,165,156,243,21,111,191,73,122,236,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
