Just before catching his train, he asks Emil, a Russian film director on his way to be a judge at the Cannes Film festival to use his camcorder to record his boarding, but accidentally causes Emil being left behind at the station.\n\nBean attempts to cheer up the director's son Stepan as the train continues south but matters are made more hectic by the fact that Emil has reported his son to have been kidnapped and Bean losing his wallet and essential travel documents at a pay phone where he and Stepan attempt to contact Emil.\n\nHeading in the direction of Cannes, Bean finds himself in the cast and disrupting the flow of a commercial being shot by the egotistical director Carson Clay.\n\nHe and Stepan finally hitch a ride with the young and vivacious actress Sabine who is heading to Cannes to attend the premiere of Clay's film, in which she appears.\n\nAfter Bean sneaks into the showing, his camcorder images are destined to enliven the proceedings. Written by Brian Greenhalgh\n\n\nStarring:\nRowan Atkinson, Willem Dafoe, Emma De Caunes, Jean Rochefort, Karel Roden\n\nDirected by: Steve Bendelack\n\nOriginal DvDrip to Xvid\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d72c96630102e0ada9af6abc39912117ffae18","amp;dn":"Mr.+Bean%5C%27s+Holiday+%282007%29+-++DvDrip+Xvid+-+Omifast+Greek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d72c96630102e0ada9af6abc39912117ffae18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,215,44,150,99,1,2,224,173,169,175,106,188,57,145,33,23,255,174,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
