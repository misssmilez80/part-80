A specially trained squad of guinea pigs is dispatched to stop a diabolical billionaire, who plans to taking over the world with household appliances.\n\nReview\n\nI thought this film was great,i don't understand why it didn't get a higher score.\n\nThe storyline was fast paced, the animation and effects superb and the guinea pigs were generally funny.\n\nI thought the cast really made the characters come alive,\n\nI would definitely recommend this for families and children,\n\nthe people giving it a bad review are not those whom it was made for. It is simply just a fun action film for kids, its's not trying to be a tarentino masterpiece, Disney did a great job on making another great flick for the family! The play-station game is great too!!
