In my opinion, Windows XP x64 SP2 Pro is a rather underrated OS - its one of the better OS released by MS.\n\nIn our edition no Tools like Nlite was used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size and perhaps a bit longer installation time. But we feel that this will be worth it - I have been running an earlier one for over 3 months in my home system. Its still running well. \n\nYou can enable automatic updates if you have the guts to do it.. it will work..\n\nCD-Key: VCFQD-V9FX9-46WVH-K3CD4-4J3JM \n\nRegards, \nHoodiboY for RocksTeam \n\nFor further discussion/opinion/critcs come to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rocksteam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rocksteam.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4841c0d2e8f8ab4c6416cd6934264b1c5019da2d","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+x64+Professional+-+updated+upto+Nov+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4841c0d2e8f8ab4c6416cd6934264b1c5019da2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,65,192,210,232,248,171,76,100,22,205,105,52,38,75,28,80,25,218,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
