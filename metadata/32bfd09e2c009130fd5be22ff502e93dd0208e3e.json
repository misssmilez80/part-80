I removed the silent section and split the two songs into separate tracks, otherwise leaving the files unchanged.\n\nMC Lars' early album Insectivorous had been floating around the Internet in MP3 (see http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5482796 for the MP3 version). It was recently rereleased by Lars, with a FLAC option available, to celebrate the success of the Kickstarter campaign used to fund the upcoming Lars Attacks album.\n\nThe Insectivorous FLACs are what you shall find here. Enjoy that, and my other Lars torrents.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32bfd09e2c009130fd5be22ff502e93dd0208e3e","amp;dn":"MC+Lars+-+Insectivorous+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32bfd09e2c009130fd5be22ff502e93dd0208e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,191,208,158,44,0,145,48,253,91,226,47,245,2,233,61,208,32,142,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
