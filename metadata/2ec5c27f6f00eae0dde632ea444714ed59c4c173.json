Their album has a great cover. The contents incorporate several different styles. All the music is written by W. David Mohr and much of it is heavy with lots of fuzz guitar reminiscent of Iron Butterfly. It ranges from heavy soul (I Just Want To Make Love To You); hippie pop (Leaf Clover); a sorta West Coast sound which seems in places distinctly similar to Fever Tree's San Francisco Girls; pretentious pop with lots of keyboards (Midnight Candle); gimmickry with lots of sound effects (Does Your Head Need Straightening?) to the very plesant After The Storm, which has some delighfful soothing piano.\n(Fuzz, Acid &amp; Flowers)\n\nTracks:\n\n01. Debby's Party\n02. Ballad of Captain Bob and the Good Ship Venus\n03. Love Allusions\n04. Milk &amp; Honey Lovin'\n05. I Just Want to Make Love to You\n06. 4 Leaf Clover\n07.
