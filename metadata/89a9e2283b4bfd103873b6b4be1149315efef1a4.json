They are currently recording the follow-up, &quot;Another Way To Exist&quot;, which is scheduled for release in spring 2010.\n\nInspired by the writings of Terence McKenna and Alan Watts and others, the band states that it's mission is to &quot;explore consciousness and eat chicken wings&quot;. Curiously, over half of the songs on &quot;Live For What's Beautiful&quot; are older Jason Moon compositions dealing with lost love, bitterness, bad religion, and uncertainty. The band's website (www.bridgesoflight.ca) states that these were included to show Moon's musical journey from a self-centred world view to a more enlightened one where beauty and love are the reality.\n\nThe album is Beatlesque in that there are several musical styles coming in to play. From the jangly acoustic folkiness of songs like &quot;Your One And Only&quot; and &quot;Sail Away From Your Smile&quot; through scorching blues rock numbers like &quot;The Shadows Know&quot; (currently riding high on the charts of GarageBand.com) to the psychedelic climax of &quot;Ocean Of Consciousness&quot;, the ever-present harmonies, skilled guitar work, and tight rhythm section tie everything together seamlessly.\n\nOther links to explore include &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bridgesoflight.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bridgesoflight.ca&lt;/a&gt; (the band's official website)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89a9e2283b4bfd103873b6b4be1149315efef1a4","amp;dn":"Bridges+Of+Light+-+Live+For+What%5C%27s+Beautiful+-+FULL+ALBUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89a9e2283b4bfd103873b6b4be1149315efef1a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,169,226,40,59,75,253,16,56,115,182,180,190,17,73,49,94,254,241,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
