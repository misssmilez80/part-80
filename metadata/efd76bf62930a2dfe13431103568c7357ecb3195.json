Please review the EP, and spread the word. Plans for the Concept album of The Typewriter is in motion, and Tory will be playing at a theater local to the composer. The songs are played on solo piano by the composer and recorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta.\n\nFrom the composer: Many thanks to everyone for helping with this small, yet significant project. Both shows are really moving forward, especially The Typewriter. Many thanks to my &quot;family&quot; in Costa Rica who were so inspiring to this project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd76bf62930a2dfe13431103568c7357ecb3195","amp;dn":"Selections+from+The+Typewriter+and+Tory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd76bf62930a2dfe13431103568c7357ecb3195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,215,107,246,41,48,162,223,225,52,49,16,53,104,199,53,126,203,49,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
