Impressed by Tim's ingenuity, his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) invites him to a &quot;dinner for winners&quot; in which he must find and bring an eccentric person with a special talent; the winner earns a trophy and the executive that brought him or her gets glory. He soon learns it is more of a &quot;dinner for idiots&quot;, and the partygoers will be mocked mercilessly. Meanwhile, Tim's girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) lands a curator deal for eccentric artist Kieran Vollard (Jemaine Clement), and Tim unsuccessfully proposes to her, as he has done several times before. After learning of the cruel nature of the dinner party, Julie becomes upset and asks him not to attend and he agrees.\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRelease date: 20 August 2010 (UK)\n\ncast\n\n# Steve Carell as Barry Speck\n# Paul Rudd as Timothy J Conrad\n# Zach Galifianakis as Therman Murch\n# Jemaine Clement as Kieran Vollard\n# Bruce Greenwood as Lance Fender\n# Ron Livingston as Caldwell\n# Andrea Savage as Robin\n# Lucy Punch as Darla\n# David Walliams as Mueller\n# Stephanie Szostak as Julie\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Dinner for Schumcks 2010 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2094.60 MiB\nDuration: 1h 54mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 568 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1924 08d04a4\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/68114181399933641905.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/68114181399933641905.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/33119169868125358020.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/33119169868125358020.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24963753331524210262.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24963753331524210262.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/54659864782972656551.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/54659864782972656551.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/80086332214428555176.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/80086332214428555176.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/70176814804910040468.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/70176814804910040468.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d2efb71b13b4cd202bbd0f97527d0da56356b9e","amp;dn":"Dinner+for+Schmucks+2010+720p+BRRip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Relea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d2efb71b13b4cd202bbd0f97527d0da56356b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,46,251,113,177,59,76,210,2,187,208,249,117,39,208,218,86,53,107,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
