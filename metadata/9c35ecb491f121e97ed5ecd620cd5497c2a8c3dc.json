This album was actually the second and final studio release from the four piece band but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enough here to tell he still had some prime blues-rock music within him although it does sound on occasions that the band were looking for a hit single too. The over-polished, smooth cover of Kim CarnesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss You TonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the most obvious hit-hunt.  Owing a fair bit to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDriveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by The Cars its actually the only certainty IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d skip if this were on cd.\n\nPositively though, there are four or five very decent blues-rockers on here, all of which you feel could have been candidates for inclusion on a Whitesnake album if Coverdale had decided to stick with the British flavoured sound rather than look for wider spread acceptance.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe ThingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has the nice soft acoustic start before building into a Zeppelin tinged rocker and its side one companion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHelp YourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ could also, with a bit of work on the chorus perhaps, have graced any early ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Snake album.  The final three offerings of side two are also in the classic blues-rock vein.  Bass guitarist/piano player Brian Badhams solo composition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWoman Like YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ offers a couple of all too brief solo spots reminding of why Marsden is a respected if un-celebrated guitarist whilst the punchy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSchoolgirlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the excellent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLove ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ reminiscent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œS.O.S.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ both improve on that, the final track at last offering space for Marsden to really stretch out a bit and shine.\n\nA different direction is taken with the other tracks.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere Did They GoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a more American flavoured AOR feel due in a large way to guest saxophonist Billy Paul taking the lead solo.  More surprisingly, although perhaps not given the mid-eighties release, a couple of tracks have more in common with the pomp rockers Magnum.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRun With The PackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a Bad Company cover but is more like a Bryan Adams number with hints of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBack Street KidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, whilst the synthesiser and big chorus opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Really Want To KnowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is pure Clarkin/Catley country.\n\nIn vinyl format especially you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but notice the cover art.  Credited to one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGary Marsh at Clock This LtdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he must have given many seconds to considering the band name and thinking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m seeing a snow covered scene hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
