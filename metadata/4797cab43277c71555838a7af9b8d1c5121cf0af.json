Comments about favourite artists much appreciated. And I wouldn't mind someone completing my collection as I remember there being at least 5966 .RBS files out there :) I'm quite certain there can't be too many songs made with a mod not included here. Enjoy!\n\nP.S. You have to use the full ISO legally downloadable as torrent from www.rebirthmuseum.com. Probably found here as well. Daemon-Tools FTW.\n\n156 ReBirth Mods: M-E G-A U-P-L O-A-D link: http://www.[theirsite].com/?d=GWT7QYHT [it's legal since ReBirth is now legal...]\n\n3604 ReBirth Songs: http://koti.mbnet.fi/sairas/3604%20ReBirth%20Songs.rar\n\nP.P.S. 156 mods is a sick amount of mods to put in ReBirth's mod folder, so you should get your hands on e.g. the 44 mods pack and then add mods from the big collection whenever there's a need.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4797cab43277c71555838a7af9b8d1c5121cf0af","amp;dn":"156+ReBirth+Mods+%26+3604+ReBirth+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4797cab43277c71555838a7af9b8d1c5121cf0af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,151,202,180,50,119,199,21,85,131,138,122,249,184,209,197,18,28,240,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
