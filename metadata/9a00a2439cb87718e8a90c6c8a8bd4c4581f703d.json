Gain up to 2 stops of dynamic range under all lighting conditions.\n\nAutomatic corrections\n\nLet DxO Optics Pro automatically batch-process your images to achieve anÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  optimal rendering, thanks to DxO Labs' preliminary calibration of cameras and lenses under all shooting conditions.\n\nPersonalized settings\nDxO Optics Pro also gives you the possibility of manually adjusting the corrections, with setting tools that allow you to achieve exactly the results you expect.\n\nSingle Shot HDR\n\nHDR in one shot\n\nDxO Optics Pro now offers the possibility of creating an HDR image from a single image file (JPEG or RAW) in one click. Depending on equipment and shooting conditions, by using differential corrections of exposure, contrast and color, it is possible to reproduce an HDR effect without having to superimpose several different exposures (the traditional method for obtaining HDR).\nWith the new, more powerful DxO Lighting, you can retrieve information in burned or clipped areas and restore the entire dynamic range of your photo. Adjust local and global contrast independently to bring out hidden elements and to give a sense of depth. The presets &quot;HDR&quot; (realistic and artistic) include this contrast correction, allowing you to easily produce an HDR image.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â \nNew RAW converter\n\nDevelop your RAW files without constraints\n\nDxO Optics Pro includes a powerful tool for developing your RAW files. The new RAW converter provides a high noise reduction regardless of the ISO, for even more perfect processing.\nCertain conditions commonly call for shooting at high ISO. For example, dense shadows require having locally higher ISO sensitivity. DxO Optics Pro meets the needs of photographers by offering an incomparably effective noise reduction not just for medium-to-high ISO (between 400 and 1600 ISO), but also for very high ISO (up to 100 000 ISO).\n\nOptical corrections\n\nStill more DxO Optics Modules\nEver since the first optical corrections module became available in 2004, our laboratories have been increasing their production rate every year. Currently, more than 2500 DxO Optics Modules areÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  available. We plan to significantly increase the rate of production to achieve 5000 modules by the end of 2011.\nWe plan to offer more DxO Optics Modules for cameras already supported, and to more quickly support new cameras, new lenses and top-of-the-line digital compacts as they become available.\n\nInterface and use\n\nFaster and more intuitive for greater efficiency\n\nThe version 6 interface has been designed to facilitate its use by beginners and to allow users of previous versions to optimize their workflow. Different work areas are available depending on your level of technical knowledge (first steps, the essentials,Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  power user, etc.).\n\nYou can also use DxO Optics Pro with Adobe Lightroom Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 3 software andÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â integrate the two into a single workflow.\n\nNew features: \n\n* More comfort and performance.\n\n* New DxO Optics Pro version 6 offers many additional features for perfect\n  corrections.\n\n* Manual optical corrections are now available for images not yet \n  covered by a DxO Optics Module.\n\n* The library of presets has been widely expanded to offer even more\n  processing options in a single click.\n\n* A &quot;first steps&quot; assistant guides you when you begin.\n\n* You can open the &quot;Project&quot; window separately, and your images can\n  be displayed on multiple lines.\n\n* Download and installation are much faster, and DxO Optics Modules\n  are automatically downloaded when adding images to the project.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS X.5 or above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a00a2439cb87718e8a90c6c8a8bd4c4581f703d","amp;dn":"DXO+Optics+Pro+v+6.5.6+elite+%2B+Patch+%5BK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a00a2439cb87718e8a90c6c8a8bd4c4581f703d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,0,162,67,156,184,119,24,232,169,12,108,138,139,212,196,88,31,112,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
