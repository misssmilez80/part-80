Patrician IV's authentic     \n       supply and demand-based trading system allows players to grow       \n       their business and head out to the high seas to form trading        \n       routes with other Hanseatic cities negotiating better prices for    \n       the buying and selling of goods. Sea battles keep the pace          \n       action-backed, as players combat pirates and enemy players.         \n\n       Patrician IV Content Update 1.3 Changelog:                          \n\n       Read from Update.1.3.EN.txt                                         \n\n\n                                  iNSTALL NOTES                           \n\n             - Install the game                                            \n             - Enjoy ;)                                                    \n\n      Attention: Install the game takes ~6 minutes (Core2Duo E8500 3.16GHz) \n       Do not close the black window archiver.
