Fishbone: If changing mapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s structure to fishbone, add summary to a topic, drag and add more topic into this summary, click print, the layout is chaos. When reopening this map, the layout will be chaos too.\n   2. Extract Theme: If we extract a theme(named theme 1), close and reopen xmind, then extract another theme(its name will be the theme 1 automatically,), change its name (like to be theme 2).Now when we reopen XMind, the theme 2 is lost.\n   3. Context Menu: Only in the first sheet of the first workbook, select a topic and right-click mouse, you can see the full context menu(including markers, and structures).\n   4. Upload map: If we add some special theme or style to a map and upload it to http://share.xmind.net/, then download this map and open it, all special theme and style will disappear.\n   5. Import XMind 2008 file: If the map has wallpaper, that wallpaper will lose after being imported.\n   6. Import FreeMind 0.9: Some Freemind 0.9 files can not be right imported into XMind.\n   7. Extract style: Sometimes, your extracted style will disappear after re-launching XMind Pro.\n   8. Export dialog and others works well on Ubuntu, esp 9.10.\n   9. Copying multiple lines which begins with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTabÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will cause XMind crash.\n  10. Some other bugs fixed.\n\nImprovements\n\n   1.
