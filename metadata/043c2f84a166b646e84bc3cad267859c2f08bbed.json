They dwell in a special fluid         \n    called Ooze B-50 and offer a great time of pure fun. Three            \n    different game modes are waiting for you. CHAIN REACTION              \n    Meet Blasties with a very sensitive, unbalanced system which makes    \n    them explode if they hit anything in the fluid. Your job here is to   \n    create a chain of subsequent explosions in order to reach a given     \n    popping percentage indicated in the top-left corner of the screen.    \n    CRITICAL MASS Meet Floaties, who attract each other very strongly.    \n    When two of these species get too close to each other, they will      \n    merge into a bigger, mutated entity. COLLECTOR Some Floaties are      \n    just too lazy to attract each other and merge. They don't feel the    \n    urge to team up and become a bigger and stronger entity. So you       \n    have the chance to play with them and collect them into crates.       \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.invictus-games.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.invictus-games.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                        \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                 ..:INSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES:..               \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Double click on .ipa and then synchro your iphone with itunes.       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: IMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Start CORE10k.EXE to verify that this release comes really from    \n       CORE.
