What you will find will amaze you. All it took was for someone to really have a close look at some of your laws (statutes).\n\nI put all five of his movies together in one torrent and in AVI format, for smaller size. \n\n\n-Bursting Bubbles of Government Deception\n-Magnificent Deception \n-With Lawful excuse \n-Demokery \n-Security of the Person\n\n\n\n Ask yourself, are you an observer of, or a participant?\n \nA participant is one who accepts everything he's told and acts upon it as if it was his own thought. An observer accepts the fact that what he thought was said may not have been exactly what was said, not out of cynicism or fear, but out of personal responsibility to himself. With some acceptance, it becomes more than prudent to question the commanding rhetoric of authority than to go through life as a willfully blind and obedient participant. \n\n-naturalperson.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93466bb8efd6e209bc26093d3f8a0958950967d0","amp;dn":"Freeman+on+the+land+-+Robert+Menard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93466bb8efd6e209bc26093d3f8a0958950967d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,70,107,184,239,214,226,9,188,38,9,61,63,138,9,88,149,9,103,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
