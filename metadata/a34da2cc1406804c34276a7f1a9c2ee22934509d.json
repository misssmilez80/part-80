My home country of Sweden is awful in this regard with its by far highest cost per inmate kept in the penal system, and with little result to show for it. Swedish prisons are luxurious and very comfortable to live in, they certainly don't do their job of deterring people from committing crimes. Watching documentaries on Joe Arpaio and his Tent City inspired me and showed me that there's a better way of dealing with crime than the pampering of criminals that Sweden excels at.\n\nIn 2010, the average cost per inmate kept in Swedish prison was 1,001,560 crowns per year, or about $165,000 with the current exchange rate.

Source: http://community.nicic.gov/blogs/corrections_headlines/archive/2011/04/18/pew-state-by-state-study-reveals-40-recidivism-rate.aspx\n\nA study by the Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies found that the recidivism rate for Arizona (home of Joe Arpaio and his Tent City, both of which were featured in the video) was 24.5%. Source: http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/aug/20/study-suggests-nevada-prisons-do-pretty-good-job-p/\n\nThe Swedish crime rate has been exploding for decades, averaging a 5% yearly increase in violent crime. Last year saw a new peak in the number of homicides with 333 reported cases, an increase by 44%.
