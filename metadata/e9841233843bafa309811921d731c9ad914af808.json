Some of the added          \n    features included with MediaMonkey Gold are:                          \n                                                                          \n    * File Monitor - Automatically updates the Library any time you       \n      modify, add, move, or delete a music file (within specified         \n     directories), saving you from doing so manually.                     \n    * Custom Filters &amp; Views - Allow you to set up subcollections of      \n      music (e.g. Kids Music, Classical Music, etc.) that have            \n     different columns, nodes, and playback rules.                        \n    * Advanced AutoPlaylists - Allow you to define a playlist based on    \n      almost any criteria. For example, if you wanted music for a         \n     party, you could have an AutoPlaylist that includes 100 Songs in     \n      which Bitrate&gt;=128 Kbps, Tempo= fast/veryfast, Year=1990-2000,      \n      Rating&gt;=4 stars, Genre=Rock. Advanced AutoPlaylists are also        \n      especially useful for synchronizing with a Portable device as       \n      they allow you to quickly choose which subset of tracks to          \n     synch.                                                               \n    * Auto-Conversion - Converts tracks on-the-fly from an unsupported    \n      format as they are synced to a portable device or burned to a       \n      CD/DVD. In addition, it levels volume on-the-fly, which is a        \n      huge benefit for most non-iPod devices, and CD/DVDs.                \n    * Automated Organization - Allows you to set up custom rules for      \n      re-organizing tracks in the background.                             \n    * Virtual CD - Allows you to keep track of what CDs you own and at    \n      the same time see which subset of tracks from those CDs are         \n     copied to your hard drive. Instead of tracking your CDs and          \n     tracks separately, the virtual CD function gives you an              \n     integrated view.                                                     \n    * Unlimited MP3 encoding - Allows you to encode MP3s in an            \n     unlimited fashion.                                                   \n                                                                          \n    URL: http://www.mediamonkey.com/                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Use our keymaker to register the application.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
