Acting as his own director of photography, Steven Soderbergh employs an innovative, color-coded cinematic treatment to distinguish the interwoven stories of a newly appointed drug czar and his family, a West Coast kingpin's wife, a key informant, and cops on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Rarely has a film so energetic and suspenseful presented a more complex and nuanced view of an issue of such international importance. Instantly recognized as a classic, Traffic appeared on more than 200 critics' ten-best lists, and earned five Academy Award nominations.\n\nREAD:\nTraffic\nby Manohla Dargis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/203&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/203&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nDVD Size: 7.11 + 6.55 GB -- Exact Untouched Copy\n\nRuntime (main feature): 147 minutes\n\nType: Color\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1 | Anamorphic\n\nSound (main feature): English + Spanish\n\nSubtitles: optional English\n\n\n\nSPECIAL EDITION DOUBLE-DISC SET:\n\n# Digital transfer, enhanced for 16:9 televisions.\n# Three commentary tracks: director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan; producers Laura Bickford, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, and consultants Tim Golden and Craig Chretien; composer Cliff Martinez (with two music cues not included in the film).\n# Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.\n# Twenty-five deleted scenes featuring commentary from director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan.\n# Film processing demonstration: Achieving the look of the Mexico sequences.\n# Editing demonstration with commentary from editor Stephen Mirrione.\n# Dialogue editing demonstration.\n# Additional footage featuring multiple angles from the scenes of the El Paso Intelligence Center, and the cocktail party where U.S. Senators, major politicians, lobbyists, and others state their views on the drug war.\n# Theatrical and television trailers.\n# U.S. Customs trading cards of the K-9 squad used in the detection of narcotics and illegal substances.\n# English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired.\n# Optimal image quality: RSDL dual-layer edition.\n\n\n\nPosted in: a.b.dvd.criterion\nWant more?
