So it falls to Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ along with the ever-inventive Penguins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to deliver the presents and save Christmas. And it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hurt that SantaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sleigh just might be able to make a little trip to New York City, so they can finally return to their beloved home. But during their appointed rounds, the four re-discover the magic of giving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that it is ultimately more important than their own wish to return home. Also included is a long-lasting North Pole/South Pole rivalry between the Penguins and SantaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reindeer, plus magic flying dust and a King Julien-based holiday called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJulienuary.\n\nGenre: Animation\nIMDB rating: 8.1/10 (53 votes)\nDirected by: David Soren\nStarring: Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of DVDRip for portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) and computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor vicerock (mod):\n\nvicerock, PLEASE, do not move my torrents to &quot;Handhelds&quot; category.
