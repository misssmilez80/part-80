Freedman's Speech given in 1961 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. [Original Audio + Transcript]\n\n\n\nBenjamin H. Freedman was one of the most intriguing and amazing individuals of the 20th century. Born in 1890, he was a\nsuccessful Jewish businessman of New York City at one time principal owner of the Woodbury Soap Company. He broke with\norganized Jewry after the Judeo-Communist victory of 1945, and spent the remainder of his life and the great\npreponderance of his considerable fortune, at least 2.5 million dollars, exposing the Jewish tyranny which has enveloped\nthe United States.\n\n\n\nMr. Freedman knew what he was talking about because he had been an insider at the highest levels of Jewish\norganizations and Jewish machinations to gain power over our nation. Mr. Freedman was personally acquainted with Bernard\nBaruch, Samuel Untermyer, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, and many more movers and\nshakers of our times. This speech was given before a patriotic audience in 1961 at the Willard Hotel, Washington, D.C.,\non behalf of Conde McGinley's patriotic newspaper of that time, Common Sense.\n\n\n\nAudio file technical details:\n\n\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio at 32.0 Kbps\n\nLength : 28 MiB for 2h 0mn 59s 580ms\n\n\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 32.0 Kbps\n\nInfos : 2 channels, 16.0 KHz\n\n\n\nEncoded to MP3 by Phoenix76 using LAME 3.98.2\n\nSource: WAV format from Audio CD kindly provided by Reboot |\nhttp://tracker.conspiracycentral.net/account-details.php?id=9\n\nOriginal Audio CD torrent hosted at http://tracker.conspiracycentral.net/torrents-details.php?id=4707\n\n\n\nFor more information on the subject visit\n\n\nChris Bollyn | http://www.bollyn.com/\n\nDaryl Bradford Smith | http://www.iamthewitness.com/\n\nEric Hufschmid | http://www.erichufschmid.net/ | http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5186601/\n\nMike Delaney | http://www.prothink.org/\n\nMissing Links | http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5183128/\n\nThe Money Masters | http://www.themoneymasters.com/\n\nInstitute for Historical Review | http://www.ihr.org/\n\nTalmudTimmy | http://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy/\n\n\n\nRead the Transcript at http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/israel/freedman.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a363583e73317c8e93bf0fe6954be27c36e3121","amp;dn":"Benjamin+H.+Freedman%5C%27s+Speech+%26+Transcript","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a363583e73317c8e93bf0fe6954be27c36e3121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,54,53,131,231,51,23,200,233,59,240,254,105,84,190,39,195,110,49,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
