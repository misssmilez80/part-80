If you run it on an old PSP model, the game will crash after 5-10 minutes. I present you a PSP port of one of the best and classic RPG games all-around: ULTIMA VII. It is based on an open-source engine EXULT.\n\nThis pack consists of:\n\n1. Ultima 7 (part one): The Black Gate + Forge of Virtue expansion pack.\n2. Ultima 7 (part two): The Serpent Isle + Silver Steed expansion pack.\n3. Complete set of original documentation, books, maps and journals in PDF format.\n4. BOOKR - a PDF/TXT reading tool for the PSP so you can read all the necessary game literature while on the go.\n\nJournals, Maps and Docs:\n--------------------------\n\nUltima 7 consists of two parts - The Black Gate and The Serpent Isle and should be played in that order. Start Serpent Isle only after you're done with The Black Gate as this is a direct continuation of the story. Like I mentioned already, back in the day, all the grand games came with several pages long manuals that contained various novels/journals that explained the detailed storylines to further immerse you in the game.\nIn this release I included all scanned docs for your pleasure. These lectures are obligatory BEFORE playing the game.\n\nA) The Black Gate\n\n- The Book of Fellowship.pdf (necessary read before you start the actual game, is also required to properly answer several in-game questions)\n- Isle of Fire Journal (optional read if you plan to visit the Isle of Fire in the game)\n- Map (required to properly answer several in-game questions)\n- Mapref.pdf (required to properly answer several in-game questions)\n- Answers.txt (for these people who want it the easy way, NOT RECOMMENDED as it takes away from the experience)\n\nB) The Serpent Isle\n\n- Journal.pdf (necessary read before you start the actual game, is also required to properly answer several in-game questions)\n- Map.pdf (required to properly answer several in-game questions)\n- Map ref.pdf (required to properly answer several in-game questions)\n- Walkthrough.pdf (for these people who want it the easy way, NOT RECOMMENDED as it takes away from the experience)\n- Answers.pdf (for these people who want it the easy way, NOT RECOMMENDED as it takes away from the experience)[/i][/b]\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n1.Unrar\n\n2.Put &quot;ExultPSP&quot; folder into your &quot;ms0:PSPGAME&quot; directory and run it like you usually run your homebrew.\n\n3.Put &quot;Bookr0.713xx&quot; folder into your &quot;ms0:PSPGAME&quot; directory. Afterwards, copy the &quot;Book Maps Manuals Answers&quot; folder into &quot;ms0:PSPGAMEBookr0.713xxBooks&quot; directory and run BookR whenever you want to read the included docs.\n\n4.
