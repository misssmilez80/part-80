The PSP actually supports\nthis better than the 720x480 anamorphic videos.  I don't believe they ever actually\ncoded proper support for that.  You may have a reason to create the lower quality\n640x480 videos, so use it if you like.  (like maybe xbmc on xbox v1 plays them better)\n\nThere is also a fix regarding 640x480 4:3 iPod videos.  Appears you need refs = 2\notherwise you get black screen on ipod 5th gen.\n\nOther than that there are perhaps a couple bit rate adjustments and hard forcing of\n25 FPS for PAL.  Oh one more thing.  ffmpeg has broken somewhere a little past\n18922 where it will not accept piped audio or perhaps all piped inputs.  So to\nget around that you have to call faac directly.  The symbolic linked encode-handheld.pl works with piped audio and 18922 svn.  The other one is for newer ffmpegs and calls faac directly for audio processing.\n\nSo I have included ffmpeg 18922 in the Linux binaries.  If you want to compile the latest and greatest ffmpeg but still be able to use piped audio then modify the code where it calls ffmpeg to process the piped audio to direct call ffmpeg-18922 static binary.  Or if you want to just use your newest and greatest ffmpeg and dont care if ffmpeg doesn't process the audio then just use the broken-piped-audio script where I just changed the commented code line around. The main reason for using ffmpeg to process the audio is you can give it start and stop times, by calling faac directly you cannot.\n\nAfter more testing I should probably just default DVD encodes to always have a start time of -j1 or +1 to whatever -j you choose.  There are just so many that go out of sync unless you skip the first milliseconds.\n\nOnce again I highly recommend using vobcopy for your dvd ripping. Refer to above.\n\nIf you are ripping from a DVD that didn't come in .img format or .iso and is just\na directory of VIDEO_TS you can mount that by using\n\nmount -o bind movie_dir /mnt/disk (providing movie_dir had a subfolder of VIDEO_TS)\nthen vobcopy like normal\nremember to umount /mnt/disk\n\nffmpeg*, AtomicParsley, encode-handheld* should all be in /usr/local/bin\nSo use sudo to move them or root.\n\n-HR\n\n\n\nnote:\n\nin case this dies, which in all likely hood it will you can also get via RS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rs.com/files/254028257/encode-handheld-4.8.tar.gz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rs.com/files/254028257/encode-handheld-4.8.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;\n\nreplace rs with real url.\n\n\nmessed around with a ps3 recently.
