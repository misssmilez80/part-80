Aired in early 2000, the program was a fresh concept to audiences, attracting high ratings and much attention in the media.\n\nThis exposure resulted in the instant success of their debut single &quot;Poison&quot; and debut album Bardot, both entering the Australian and New Zealand charts at number 1 and highly in parts of Asia.\n\nIn 2001, Bardot released their second album Play it Like That, featuring the Top 5 ARIA singles &quot;ASAP&quot; and &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;, with greater creative control and this resulted in many strong reviews.\n\nDespite making the decision to part ways in 2002, Bardot remains the most successful act of all four Australian Popstars seasons.\n\n1.&quot;Play It Like That&quot; (Ollie J/M.Morgan/P.Jacobs)\n2.&quot;I Need Somebody&quot; (R.Hedges/N.Butler/J.Pickering)\n3.&quot;Feel Right&quot; (S.Polihronas/S.Monk]]/M.Szumowski)\n4.&quot;ASAP&quot; (F.Odesjo/H.Jonback/J.McLaughlin)\n5.&quot;Don't Call Me, I'll Call You&quot; (B.Chapple]]/M.
