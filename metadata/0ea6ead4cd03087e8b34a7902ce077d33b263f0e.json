It is rather not full-on, traditional jazz with multiple instruments...etc, - it's more slow jazz with a little acid/electronic vibe - a nice combination of beats/rhythms/taps which allows for easy listening. The album starts off with slow but soothing music, with a surreal ambiance that captures you, then progresses to faster, more upbeat, funky-jazzy music during the 2nd half of the CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea6ead4cd03087e8b34a7902ce077d33b263f0e","amp;dn":"Soul+Ballet+-+Vibe+Cinema+%5B2000%2FCD%2FFLAC%2FLossless%2FLog%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea6ead4cd03087e8b34a7902ce077d33b263f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,166,234,212,205,3,8,126,139,52,167,144,44,224,119,211,59,38,63,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
