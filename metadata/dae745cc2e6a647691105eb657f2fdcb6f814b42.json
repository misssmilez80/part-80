John Turtorro plays the chief Hostage Negotiator who finds he is a fish out of water without Garber.\n\nJohn Travolta co-stars as Ryder, the criminal mastermind who, as leader of a highly-armed gang of four, including a subway-knowledgeable henchman, (played by Luis Guzman), threatens to execute the train's passengers unless a large ransom is paid within one hour. As the tension mounts beneath his feet, Garber employs his vast knowledge of the subway system in a battle to outwit Ryder and save the hostages.\n\nCamonetti starts the movie taking charge of the situation, suspecting Garbers complicity, but realizes his mistake when his actions cause the death of a hostage. Realizing that only Garber can solve the problem, he spends the rest of the movie making Garbers job easier by becoming the Liaison between his SWAT Team and Garber. In the end, it is Garber who solves the riddle of how the criminals intend to get away with the money.\n\n*******************************\nMovieFOX\nJoin us at http://moviefox.org\n*******************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae745cc2e6a647691105eb657f2fdcb6f814b42","amp;dn":"The+Taking+Of+Pelham+123+%282009%29+TS+XVID-MAXSPEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae745cc2e6a647691105eb657f2fdcb6f814b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,231,69,204,46,106,100,118,145,16,94,182,87,242,253,203,111,129,75,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
