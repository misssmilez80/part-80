During this 7-hour live event, they will examine the reported hauntings and ghostly activity at this legendary landmark.\n\nBuilt during the Civil War, the asylum is the second-largest hand-cut stone building in the world. For decades its thick walls housed the insane, the neglected and the unwanted. Violence was a common occurrence and inmates were often subjected to brutal treatment. Shut down permanently in 1994, this massive edifice has remained vacant ever since.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb85203be84babcaf6f03060e84afbfe16809e9","amp;dn":"Ghost+Adventures+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb85203be84babcaf6f03060e84afbfe16809e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,184,82,3,190,132,186,188,175,111,3,6,14,132,175,191,225,104,9,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
