A new technologies that were especially designed to quickly detect, deter and destroy any malware that could reside in your computer.\n\nThe Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware application was designed to monitor every process and actually stops malicious processes before they even start. It uses our impressive technology that is in fact a completely novel way of heuristic scanning and it is our response to the increasingly complex malware threats.\n\nAnd, as we did with our Malwarebytes' RogueRemover we also have added a threats center. You can simply check online which pests are removed the most and thus are the most prevalent.\n\nNote: Some antivirus and antispyware programs flag Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware as being infected/malware, although the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your system. This is called a 'false positive'. The term false positive is used when antivirus software wrongly classifies an innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database. [Similar problems can occur with antitrojan or antispyware software.]\n\nxxxxxxxxxxx\nx N O T E x\nxxxxxxxxxxx                                                                     \n\noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noALL my uploads scanned by Kaspersky Anti-Viruso                            \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n                                                                      \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noThey WON'T be here if they never passo                                 \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo                                                                      \n\noooooooooooooooooooooo\noMore of my uploads :o\noooooooooooooooooooooo\n \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\no http://thepiratebay.se/user/kentucky-kid/ o\noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noAfter your download , please leave as much information aso\noyou can in the comments section                          o\nosuch as :                                                o\no                                                         o\no* Thank You (Encourage me) (^.^)                         o\no* How you managed to get it work (Steps you take)        o \no* What problems are you facing (State ur OS)             o\no* Other users who wants to help users who are            o\no  facing problems are most welcome                       o\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\noooooooooooooooo\no Seed &amp; Enjoy o\noooooooooooooooo\n\nCheers! \n\nkentucky-kid\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ffd41ccffb781ccca995327a83a805461f1930","amp;dn":"Malwarebytes%5C%27+Anti-Malware+v1.39%2BSerial+%5B+kk+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ffd41ccffb781ccca995327a83a805461f1930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,255,212,28,207,251,120,28,204,169,149,50,122,131,168,5,70,31,25,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
