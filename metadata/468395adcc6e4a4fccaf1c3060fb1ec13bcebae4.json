While the instrumentation and overall feel is firmly within electronica (featuring mainly keyboards, \\&quot;bloops and bleeps\\&quot; and drum machines), the creators are obviously influenced by a lot of good rock and roll, indie rock, and dub, soul, etc. At the heart it\\'s melodic and pretty, but there is also a considerable amount of experimentation going on.
