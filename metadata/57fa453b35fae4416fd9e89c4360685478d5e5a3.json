Swimming free, a young dolphin is caught in a crab trap, severely damaging her tail. She is rescued and transported to the Clearwater Marine Hospital, where she is named Winter. But her fight for survival has just begun. Without a tail, Winter's prognosis is dire. It will take the expertise of a dedicated marine biologist, the ingenuity of a brilliant prosthetics doctor, and the unwavering devotion of a young boy to bring about a groundbreaking miracle--a miracle that might not only save Winter but could also help scores of people around the world. The real Winter, who plays herself in &quot;Dolphin Tale,&quot; today serves as a symbol of courage, perseverance and hope to millions of people--both able and disabled--who have been touched by her remarkable story of recovery and rehabilitation.\n\nGenre: Action and Adventure, Family\n\nDirector: Charles Martin Smith\n\nCast: Morgan Freeman, Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, Nathan Gamble\n\nWriters: Karen Janszen, Noam Dromi\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x1056 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57fa453b35fae4416fd9e89c4360685478d5e5a3","amp;dn":"Dolphin+Tale.+Official+Trailer+%5BHD%5D+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57fa453b35fae4416fd9e89c4360685478d5e5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,250,69,59,53,250,228,65,111,217,232,156,67,96,104,84,120,213,229,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
