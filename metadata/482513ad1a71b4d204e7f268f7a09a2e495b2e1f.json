Inspired by ghost stories she heard as a child from both her extended Aboriginal and Irish Australian families, Tracey Moffatt has constructed a sublime trilogy in which characters are haunted by the past and bewitched by memories. All three stories are set in MoffattÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s highly stylized, hyper-real, hyper-imaginary Australian landscape. In the first story MISTER CHUCK, a young boy is fascinated and terrified by a swamp that is haunted by the ghost of an American GI. CHOO CHOO CHOO CHOO finds a family living by railroad tracks haunted by strange happenings. The mother (played by Moffatt) is drawn to the tracks at night as she senses the horror of a past tragedy. The final story, LOVINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ THE SPIN I'M IN, follows a woman who resists eviction attempts by her landlord so she can keep vigil for her dead son.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/Bedevilavi_000963399.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/Bedevilavi_000963399.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/Bedevilavi_000822679.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/Bedevilavi_000822679.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/Bedevilavi_002397239.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/Bedevilavi_002397239.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip----\n\nFile Name .........................................: Bedevil.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,080,950,784 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:27:50\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x416 (AR: 1.654)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1465 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.205 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 163 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
