This release is a prime example. \nThe double CD was released in the new slim line jewel case with a 12 page booklet of images, \nitineraries, and reviews. Each CD is silk-screened with an image from the booklet. \nThe graphics are over the top. \nThis represents nearly the entire 28 song show in great soundboard quality. \nThe two missing songs are shown grayed out above. \nThey had never surfaced among tape traders at the time of this release. \nEach song is very tastefully edited in and out to eliminate in between song down time. \nThere is no music lost, but some purists may find it annoying. \nThere is also a small amount of white noise (tape hiss). \nThe concert recording has since been cleaned up \nand released in an even better quality as 'CHILD'S BALLOON' \n\nConcert Review \nDylan delivers a knock-out performance. The gospel material is powerful \nand biting without a condescending edge. \nThe older standards are performed with a new fire and passion that \nincludes them among the best live versions to date. \nDylan stumbles on the lyrics once or twice, but adds new lines as well that more than compensate. \nThe vocals are crisp are over the top out front and in your face. \nThe music is tight, well mixed, and well performed. \nIt might be a little dark, murky, and low in the overall mix for some tastes. \nDon't let that sway you from this incredible piece, however. \nOthers will find the vocals to music relation pure heaven. \n\nWhat I have is what you get, ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02f51b7761add5ae2b06b7f5e873a1ce7c8e625","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Stadiums+Of+The+Damned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02f51b7761add5ae2b06b7f5e873a1ce7c8e625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,47,81,183,118,26,221,90,226,176,107,127,94,135,58,28,231,200,230,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
