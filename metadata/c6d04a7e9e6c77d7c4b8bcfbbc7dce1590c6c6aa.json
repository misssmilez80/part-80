The victim is found to be Valerie's older sister Lucy. The townspeople have offered a monthly sacrifice to the Wolf and made it clear to stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry -- whom she was in love with.\n\nAdrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to hunt the Wolf and manage to behead one, Adrian is killed in the process.
