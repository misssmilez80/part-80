The arrival of new neighbours, gives him new spirit, as they are gregarious and friendly, with two children that his son can be friends with. He is even beginning to see another woman. However, he begins to suspect something is odd about the neighbours, something about the way they don't want him to see certain parts of the house, or a set of blueprints they have there. Are his neighbours terrorists... or is the stress of losing his wife merely driving him past the point of paranoia?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee5b1b91309ffe61731a938551d0fa6e7c44599","amp;dn":"Arlington+Road+%5B1999%5D+CBCS+SH%40R.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee5b1b91309ffe61731a938551d0fa6e7c44599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,229,177,185,19,9,255,230,23,49,169,56,85,29,15,166,231,196,69,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
