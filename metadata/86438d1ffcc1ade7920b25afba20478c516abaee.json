WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, ACE, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip). WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86438d1ffcc1ade7920b25afba20478c516abaee","amp;dn":"WinRAR.v4.01.Beta.1.x86.x64.Incl.Keygen-FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86438d1ffcc1ade7920b25afba20478c516abaee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,67,141,31,252,193,173,231,146,11,37,175,186,32,71,140,81,106,186,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
