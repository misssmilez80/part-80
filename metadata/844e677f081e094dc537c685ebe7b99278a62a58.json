Just double click and Enjoy!\n\nAlso 100% Virus Free!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844e677f081e094dc537c685ebe7b99278a62a58","amp;dn":"DvDx+2.10+Ultra+%28portable%29+%5BNugmonster%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844e677f081e094dc537c685ebe7b99278a62a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,78,103,127,8,30,9,77,197,55,198,133,235,231,185,146,120,166,42,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
