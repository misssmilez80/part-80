Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. \n\nAs the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. \n\nIt's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.\n\nTaken from the music/film torrent site: files24.com.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2558b242729408bd604c3f518476ded74ab387","amp;dn":"The+Italian+Job+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2558b242729408bd604c3f518476ded74ab387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,37,88,178,66,114,148,8,189,96,76,63,81,132,118,222,215,74,179,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
