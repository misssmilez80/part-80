The story unfolds as a high school track athlete is stuck in a world of anorexia and a sexual fantasy with whose terms he finds increasingly difficult to reconcile.\n\n\nReviews\n\nThere is no sanitizing of this white suburban landscape as Garchar embraces postmodern sensibilities with a skilled hand in which the young actors, drawn from a casting call of students at a Cincinnati performing arts conservatory, are realistically awkward and emotionally blunt.\n\n-Les Roka - selectiveecho.com\n\n\nI really liked your movie. Had a great tone to it. The music had a cool Eno vibe and the editing was terrific and simple with a strong ambiguity left at the end. A great use of the short film form.\n\n-David Gordon Green - Director of Pineapple Express &amp; Snow Angels, Sundance Grand Jury and Special Jury Prize Winner\n\n\nFestivals\n\nOxford International Film Festival\nBig Lens Film Festival\nAtalanta Underground Film Festival\nOhio Independent Film Festival - Cleveland\nMedCineCascais Film Festival - Portugal\nFear No Film Festival - Salt Lake City\nOhio Short Film &amp; Video Showcase - OSU Wexner Center\n\nOfficial Shortlist - 2nd Babelgum Online Film Festival\n\n\nLinks\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.createspace.com/260305&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.createspace.com/260305&lt;/a&gt; (buy a DVD w/ special features)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bengarchar.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bengarchar.com&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.somewherenevertraveled.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.somewherenevertraveled.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb518539fb5da35a34c380dda04e62e6530d4560","amp;dn":"Run+to+Me+Run+from+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb518539fb5da35a34c380dda04e62e6530d4560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,81,133,57,251,93,163,90,52,195,128,221,160,78,98,230,83,13,69,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
