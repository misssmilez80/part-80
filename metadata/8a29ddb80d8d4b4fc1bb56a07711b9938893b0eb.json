NOVA joins leading dream researchers as they embark on a variety of neurological and psychological experiments to investigate the world of sleep and dreams. Delving deep into the thoughts and brains of a variety of dreamers, scientists are asking important questions about the purpose of this mysterious realm we escape to at night. Do dreams allow us to get a good night's sleep? Do they improve memory? Do they allow us to be more creative? Can they solve our problems or even help us survive the hazards of everyday life?\n\nNOVA follows a number of scientists, including Matthew Wilson of MIT, who is literally &quot;eavesdropping&quot; on the dreams of rats, and other investigators who are systematically analyzing the content of thousands of human dreams. From people who violently act out their dreams to those who can't stop their nightmares, from sleepwalking cats to the rare instances of individuals who don't seem to ever dream, each fascinating case study contains a vital clue to the age-old question: What Are Dreams?\n\nGeneral           : PBS Nova-What Are Dreams.S37E08.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 3s 363ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 015 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 132 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a29ddb80d8d4b4fc1bb56a07711b9938893b0eb","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova-What+Are+Dreams.S37E08.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a29ddb80d8d4b4fc1bb56a07711b9938893b0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,41,221,184,13,141,75,79,193,187,86,160,119,17,185,147,136,147,176,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
