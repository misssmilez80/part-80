By the early 1980s, 38 Special began amalgamating southern rock and arena rock in their music, thereby kicking off a string of successful albums and singles.\n\nTheir first high-charting song was &quot;Hold On Loosely&quot; (1981); &quot;Caught Up In You&quot; (1982) and &quot;If I'd Been The One&quot; (1983) both hit #1 on Billboard magazine's Album Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot; (1984) continued the annual sequence of radio favorites, and &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1989), a #1 hit on Billboard's adult contemporary chart, was sung by former Specialist Max Carl.\n\nIn 2007, 38 Special was the opening act on Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr.'s Rowdy Frynds Tour, and on September 27, 2008, they filmed a CMT Crossroads special with country singer Trace Adkins, performing both artists' hits from over the years. In 2009, 38 Special opened for REO Speedwagon and Styx as part of the &quot;Can't Stop Rockin' Tour.&quot;\n\nThe current lineup consists of Barnes, Van Zant, guitarist Danny Chauncey, bassist Larry Junstrom, keyboardist Bobby Capps and drummer Gary Moffatt.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc0160e9513243d892444eda5ae7623165cf17b8","amp;dn":"38+Special+-+Wild+Eyed+Southern+Boys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc0160e9513243d892444eda5ae7623165cf17b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,1,96,233,81,50,67,216,146,68,78,218,90,231,98,49,101,207,23,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
