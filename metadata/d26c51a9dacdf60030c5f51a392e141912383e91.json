After an almost 8 year hiatus, Jim Bob the Handicapped Hillbilly and Junkyard Willie are back with a vengeance as &quot;Customer Care Creeps&quot;. It's been so long that waiting for a full album to be completed might take another 8 years or more than likely it will NEVER be completed, so these 7 calls are being released now at a reduced price without any further delay. Yes it actually takes time to A) get these calls and B) to really yank someone's chain. This 1/3 album features inbound calls for a TV news station, a hotel front desk, a computer company's billing department, and a debt collection company. There's even a call for a company that doesn't exist...The caller is angry because their computer has become infected with malware that tricked them into paying for (Trojan) phony software! Many of these caller want charges reversed immediately but Willie and Jim Bob always foul up customer claims. This 1/3 album also includes one outbound call as Jim Bob solicits rusty old used hubcaps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26c51a9dacdf60030c5f51a392e141912383e91","amp;dn":"CUSTOMER+CARE+CREEPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26c51a9dacdf60030c5f51a392e141912383e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,108,81,169,218,205,246,0,48,197,245,26,57,46,20,25,18,56,62,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
