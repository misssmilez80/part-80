Alrightly then:\n\nYea, Mininova will be missed. Boys are due back Monday, no I have not posted the guide. Unfortunately, it may not be up for a bit - I'm a perfectionist of sorts and won't release it until it's to my satisfaction. I have had alot of personal crap going on the past few weeks too. \n\nI do have good news though - I finally have the O&amp;A rig back I think. The onboard ethernet chipset was causing the sound problems, a new usb to ethernet adaptor (it's a mini pc, no slots) has fixed it - or at least the 15 minutes of test audio seemed good! \n\nI'd expect my Monday 128k vbr rip up (and the rest from here on out) around 6-7 pm est. It's going to be up to you shauz (or other peeps) to feed those fans used to 12 noon 64k ups.....\n\n\n\nI can still do some sort of live 202 stream too, I have the hardware and appropriate accounts so as to cover my ass. Unfortunately there are no really popular p2p streaming services, so anything I do will probably be relegated to obscurity. Then there's the issue of fans at work not having admin rights to install the necessary clients or problems getting around NAT routing, etc. Shoutcast would work but then there's the issue of bandwidth.....\n\nNote: Friday November 27th will be my last &quot;early&quot; 64k upload. \nStarting with Nov. 30th and on, I will upload the 128k vbr \nmp3's in the evenings. If you listen a day late, you'll be \nfine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,\nyou'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will \nbe doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending\nschedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.\n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month (again)!\nGet your O&amp;A here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d93dc94f766c21f3dbb33bd0bd2153d2421a50a9","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-11-27-O%26A+Worst+of+CF128k+VBR+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d93dc94f766c21f3dbb33bd0bd2153d2421a50a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,61,201,79,118,108,33,243,219,179,59,208,189,33,83,210,66,26,80,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
