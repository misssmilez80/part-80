Enjoy! (Multi-tracker torrent, please seed with confidence!)\n\nPlease note that this particular movie has much of its nuances and\nsensibilities conveyed in the particular expressions in the vernacular of the\nEnglish language that expressions come from now and then that makes a lot of\nmeaning which is lost in translation. As such it is going to only be mainly\nappreciated I suspect by those that are fluent enough in English to follow\nalong the British dialogue in the movie without too much difficulty as it were,\ndespite several language subtitle offerings of it for you here additionally.\n\nRussia House comes from a brilliant piece of writing by John Le Carre.\n\nIt is a message for the uniting of human beings in a common cause - survival of\nthose that deserve to be free to follow their conscience and place the welfare\nof the human race above political considerations or loyalties that are limited\nin vision as a result particularly perhaps of a brand of bigotry of sorts -\nthat caliber that tends to breed nationalism above humanism of the best spirit\nin fact.\n\nThe message of the movie is that the Russian woman that is played by Michelle\nPfeiffer so beautifully is a woman for whom we must be prepared to stake our\nfutures altogether. We must be as much for her as we are for anyone else on\nthis earth. That is the decision that Sean Connery's character makes in this\nmovie in his bid to assure that mutual deterrence is at least maintained so as\nto secure Russia against those that might strike her without just cause. This\nis his response to being asked to be a &quot;decent human being&quot; by the Russian\ncharacter in the movie that is his source of intelligence in the provision of\npossible secret information of great value in fact. There is after all no\ngreater cause for which we might choose to live than to preserve Michelle\nPfeiffer from all that would threaten her in what would be a carnage of the\nhuman spirit. Sean Connery's character is therefore acting in good conscience\nfor us all in making our world a better place to be based on good sense alone.\nShe additionally certainly inspired romantic love and passion and no doubt this\nfactors in for Connery's character in the movie additionally.\n\nIt was sad to see how little Russia was aided in its drive towards democracy\nand a free economy at a time when help was most needed. This is something that\nshouldn't escape notice as it suggests that we do not at present follow the\nbest advice on the world stage for lack of leadership that has true and real\nwisdom as is the sort demonstrated by taking the message of this movie to\nheart. It is my most sincere hope and desire that this will in fact change and\nsoon and indeed forever more.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nPlease see this and other moviereviews at moviesbyrizzo.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797221cc167a12d44639cff32e03229491d5fd78","amp;dn":"The+Russia+House+%28Michelle+Pfeiffer%29+DivX+multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797221cc167a12d44639cff32e03229491d5fd78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,114,33,204,22,122,18,212,70,57,207,243,46,3,34,148,145,213,253,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
