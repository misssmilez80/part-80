The single was released in May 1993 and became a minor hit in the United States, peaking at number seventy-eight on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nLove Deluxe is the fourth studio album by the English group Sade, released in the United Kingdom on 11 November 1992 and in the United States on 21 November 1992 by Epic Records.\n\nSade (pronounced /ÃƒÅ Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€°Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒâ€¹Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ deÃƒâ€°Ã‚Âª/ shah-DAY) is an English group which achieved success in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The band's music features elements of soul, jazz, R&amp;B, quiet storm, soft rock, funk, easy listening, and adult contemporary. The lead vocalist, Sade Adu, is the only woman in the band and is the only one to appear on their album and single covers. Sade's 2000 release, Lovers Rock sold 3,881,000 copies in the U.S. and the prior album, 1992's Love Deluxe sold 3,407,000. Since 1985's Diamond Life debut, Sade has sold nearly 17 million units in the U.S. alone according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has sold more than 50 million units worldwide to date.\n\nSade was formed in 1982, when members of a Latin soul band Pride - Helen Folasade Adu, Stuart Matthewman, and Paul Spencer Denman - together with Paul Anthony Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. In 1983, Andrew Hale joined the band, though Cook left in 1984. Sade, named for the moniker of their lead singer, made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott's Club in London, in support of Pride. In May 1983, the band performed their first US show at Danceteria Club in New York City. Sade received more attention from the media and record companies than Pride and finally separated. On 18 October 1983, the band signed with Portrait Records. All Sade albums were released through this label until it was absorbed by its parent label Epic Records in 1986.\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50860680f85f777cffa4745012b432cf2dd8990","amp;dn":"Sade+-+Kiss+Of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50860680f85f777cffa4745012b432cf2dd8990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,8,96,104,15,133,247,119,207,250,71,69,1,43,67,44,242,221,137,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
