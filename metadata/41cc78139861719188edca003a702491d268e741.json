On the inner sleeve there is another short lyric of OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ReillyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.  In many ways it sums up the variety of moods on the fifty-five minutes of this disc which is at once romantic and dreamy, full of loss, longing and desire, yet also scathingly realistic. \nA potent and innovative amalgamation of an assortment of indigenous musical styles, from Cajun to Folk to Blues to Irish traditional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to everything in between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Cry Of A Dreamer is held together by astoundedly accomplished musicianship that is rooted in the heartfelt traditions of honesty, integrity and a compassion and understanding which can only be discovered by experiencing life openly and at first hand as opposed to reflecting upon in it an ivory tower. ~ Sean's website\n\nU.S. debut album by Irish troubadour Sean Tyrrell sounds like a long-lost gem from the vaults of an Irish folk catalog.  In fact, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a brand-new album by a current artist who happens to be profoundly steeped I Celtic tradition and untempered by modern musical influences.  The release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which was named Irish album of the year by Folk Roots ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ includes such lovely tunes as &quot;Coast Of Malabar&quot;, a traditional lyric with music by Tyrrell; a trilogy of ancient poems that Tyrrell also set to music; and such varied fare as &quot;Isle Of Innisfree&quot;, &quot;Mattie&quot;, and the title track.  Featuring Davy Spillane on Uilleann pipes and low whistle and Mairtin OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor on accordion, among others, &quot;Cry Of A Dreamer&quot; is a feast of traditional Irish music.
