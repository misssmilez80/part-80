Compare encode with 4.8 using DTS processed audio and 4.9  DTS processed audio using -M.  In 4.8 audio adjust with VLC and use -100 to -200 delay and see if it matches 4.9 audio.\n\nA lot of work went into retooling, hope it worth it.\n\nNOTE: you will have to have an ffmpeg that accepts piped input.  For a while there it was broken in SVN, but it appears fixed again.\n\n-HR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb4fa78581f3b547cbc69cca83c4c5976868aae","amp;dn":"encode-handheld.pl+v4.9+script+only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb4fa78581f3b547cbc69cca83c4c5976868aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,180,250,120,88,31,59,84,124,188,105,204,168,60,76,89,118,134,138,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
