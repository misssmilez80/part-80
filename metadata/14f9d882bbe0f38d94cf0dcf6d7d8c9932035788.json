When a Sumatran rat-monkey bites Lionel Cosgrove's mother, she's transformed into a zombie. She begins killing (and transforming) the entire town while Lionel races to keep things under control. Events culminate at a house party that turns into a blood-drenched zombie buffet.\n\nFile Type: AVI\nResolution: 852x480\nFrame Rate: 29.97\nAudio Sample Rate: 44,100Hz\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbs\nRuntime: 1:37:10\n\nPLEASE SEED!!!
