One source of every song played live from this time frame were complied together to make one continuous concert.  The sources for each song were chosen for a reason that made them stand out over all the others.  Sometimes the sources had unique and/or emphases on lyrics and instrumentals while other had fuckups that somehow made them better.\n\nThere were 66 concert sources that the songs were picked, from that 33 of them were used.  The order of the track list was chosen before the sources so there are some problems with track transitions.  Mainly volume level is an issue with some adjacent tracks because actual alteration to the tracks themselves is kept to a minimum.  You can only amplify a track so much before it starts to sound bad.\n\nI was at the Webster Hall concert in NYC so the first part of the compilation is inspired by that nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance.  The rest of the track list was created based on track flow and what sounded good to me.  All of the encores from the final nights of the wave goodbye club tour were used throughout the compilation.  The source of the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“In This TwilightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is from the final night and it is the last nine inch nails song played live, so enjoy it (crying is totally acceptable here).\n\nThis project was complied and mixed entirely by me.  Cover art made by ETS member MAD.  The audio recordings were recorded by the following tapers: RyanJ, dpieper, Dime, JB, tooligan, edgar, shotyd, DSM6, TheBang, Reaper, brianblank, ScreamingSlave, s(solitude), Jofa, gladcarrot, NINSlave, sin213, R-09HR, and coolerluzi.  Out of the respect for all of those great guys please keep their recordings in Lossless formats.  Only convert to mp3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s for personal use and do not share publicly.  Last but not least, Thank You Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor, Robin Finck, Justin Meldal-Johnson, and Ilan Rubin, you guys are fucking awesome.\n\nTracklist with sources:\n1\tMr. Self Destruct (Album Version)\t2009 08-23 Webster Hall, New York
