It is a utility that sorts your MP3's. This program scans the filename and ID tag of the MP3 to detect the Artist. \nIt then creates folders for each artist and moves the MP3 into that directory.\n\nHow do I use it?\n\tSelect the directory containing the MP3's by pressing the &quot;Select Dir&quot; button.\n\tNow press the &quot;Process MP3's&quot; button.\n\tThe files to be processed are listed in the &quot;Files to Process&quot; window.\n\tFolders being created will list in the &quot;Processed Directories&quot; window.\n\tOnce completed a dialog box will appear advertising the completion.\n\tThe &quot;Files to Process&quot; window will only contain the MP3's that the application was not able to process.\n\nWhy were some of my MP3's not processed?\n\tSome MP3's do not contain the artist within the ID tag or filename. Simply rename your MP3 with &quot;Arist - Song \nTitle.mp3&quot; or edit the ID tag using your favourite MP3 player. Winamp is my choice. (www.winamp.com)\n\nWill this program damange my MP3's?\n\tThats silly. Of course not! It scans only the filename and ID tag in Read Only. Does not write to the MP3 file.\n\nWhat is an ID tag?\n\tAn ID Tag is a 128 byte structure at the end of an MP3 file. It contains artist and track information so your filenames \ndon't need to be as long or complicated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4c74b9eb34231e9be0d33a46403eb928dde349","amp;dn":"MP3+Sort","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4c74b9eb34231e9be0d33a46403eb928dde349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,76,116,185,235,52,35,30,155,224,211,58,70,64,62,185,40,221,227,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
