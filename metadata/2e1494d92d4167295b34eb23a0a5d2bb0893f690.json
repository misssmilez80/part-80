They are considered to be one of the first and most influential punk groups. By 1975, contemporaneous with the Ramones, The Saints were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and &quot;buzzsaw&quot; guitar that characterised early punk rock. With their first single &quot;(I'm) Stranded&quot;, in late 1976, they released a record ahead of better-known punk acts like the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Bob Geldof has been quoted as saying, &quot;Rock music in the Seventies was changed by three bands ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and The Saints&quot;.\n\n\n\nLive at Paddington Town Hall Sydney 1977\n\n\nClassic footage and rare\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e1494d92d4167295b34eb23a0a5d2bb0893f690","amp;dn":"The+Saints+-+Run+Down+%5BLive+1977%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e1494d92d4167295b34eb23a0a5d2bb0893f690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,20,148,217,45,65,103,41,91,52,235,35,160,165,210,187,8,147,246,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
