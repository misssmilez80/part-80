Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 1994, it was released by G.A.S. Records of Moncton, New Brunswick; I can`t find anything online about them, either. The album is number GASRT 12, so it probably wasn`t their only release.\n\n\nMostly pop with folk influences, there`s a strong autobiographical sound to several of the songs.\n\n\nBacking musicians were Clarence Deveau, Cam Bowman, Jack Guppy, and Dave Reimer. Guest musicians were Barney Bentall, Geoffrey Kelly, Vince Ditrich, and Kim Linekin.\n\n\nRipped by Free Music CD Converter\n\n\nTrack listing:\n01. Older.flac\n02. Kick the Can.flac\n03.
