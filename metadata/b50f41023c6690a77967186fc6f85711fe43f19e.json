Rebuild from scratch. The &quot;old&quot; needed Net.framework, 1st\n   start always very slow. (as all .NET applications are)\n   We found it quite irritating even from the start.\n   So merrik wrote the new launcher in Visual Basic 6 instead. (borrowed\n   palmtrae's icons and some of his smart code)\n\n\n 1.2 (is now named Ventrilo Clients TS)\n\n * 3rd Release\n - Added Teamspeak2 2.0.66.7 Client\n - Added an optional launcher for those that prefer that (just drag launcher\n   shortcut to where you like it)\n - Name change (we know, but now we stick with this name)\n\n\n 1.1 (was named Ventrilo Clients X3)\n\n * 2nd Release\n - Added a modded Ventrilo Client 3.0.1 so it also has unique save files and\n   registry entries\n - Combined Ventrilo 2.1.4 , 2.3.0 and now 3.0.1 into same folder\n - Name change\n - Added Uninstaller\n\n\n 1.0 (Was named VentriloDual)\n\n * 1st Release\n - Modded both ventrilo clients so they have unique save files and registry entries\n - Combined Ventrilo 2.1.4 &amp; 2.3.0 into same folder\n - Made an Installer\n\n __________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\n Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50f41023c6690a77967186fc6f85711fe43f19e","amp;dn":"Ventrilo+Clients+TS+v1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50f41023c6690a77967186fc6f85711fe43f19e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,15,65,2,60,102,144,167,121,103,24,111,198,248,87,17,254,67,241,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
