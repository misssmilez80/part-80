Are You Experienced?, in September of 1967.\n\nThe album, and its successors-Axis: Bold As Love and the towering Electric Ladyland earned Hendrix international acclaim as the premier rock &amp; roll innovator of his generation.\n \nA greatest hits collection, Smash Hits (1969), and an in-concert memento of his historic Monterey appearance, Otis Redding / Jimi Hendrix Experience at Monterey (1970),followed before his untimely death in September of 1970.\n\nA posthumous studio album, The Cry Of Love, was released in January of 1971, \nfollowed by the double album soundtrack to the documentary film Jimi Hendrix in June of 1973.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n01   The Sunshine Of Your Love (Short Version) 7:05\n \n02   Bleeding Heart 8:30\n \n03   Fire 3:55\n \n04   Little Wing 3:20\n \n05   Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) 9:10\n \n06   Room Full Of Mirrors 9:00\n \n07   Purple Haze 3:10\n \n08   Wild Thing 1:21\n \n09   Wake Up This Morning And Found Yourself Dead 8:04\n \n10   Uranus Rock 6:38\n \n11   Red House 10:33 \n__________________________________________________________\n\nCountry:UK\n\nReleased:2001\n\nGenre:Rock\n\nStyle:Psychedelic Rock\n______________________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320kbs\n                               \nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30070d16b6c247cf291834514a3cbbb67c42e386","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix++Forever+Gold%28Mp3+320Kbs%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30070d16b6c247cf291834514a3cbbb67c42e386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,7,13,22,182,194,71,207,41,24,52,81,74,60,187,182,124,66,227,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
