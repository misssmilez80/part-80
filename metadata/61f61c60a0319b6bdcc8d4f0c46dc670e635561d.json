We had no intention of producing another 44-page issue for the Spring.\nHowever, as the Middle East and North Africa imploded and the US/UN/NATO bombed Libya (under the guise of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhumanitarian assistanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), trend-shaking events have piled up and compounded to such an extent that analyzing and forecasting from them called for another equally comprehensive issue. Anything less would have short-changed our subscribers.\n\nIn my 30-plus years of trend forecasting, I have never witnessed such an overwhelming barrage of world-changing events, nor have I ever been more concerned about their implications. With each new week, a new war unfurls. A ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLevel 7,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Chernobyl-grade nuclear meltdown is being battled in Japan, with no real end in sight. More failing European nations are being bailed out, while others face default as the dollar dives and the United States risks losing its AAA credit rating.\n\nMost Trends Journal readers want hard, cold, un-sugar-coated facts and forecasts, just as we deliver them. There are some subscribers, however, who despite the undeniable facts would like to see a rosier analysis. One correspondent writes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe co-create our reality and those who buy into the fear porn will create just that; negative, chaotic experiences,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and she asks why we canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t accentuate the positive and downplay the negative? \n\nWith all due regard for the honesty of the sentiment expressed, I played no part in co-creating the scores of wars raging on Planet Earth. No negative thought of mine co-created the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, and I have never been a member of the Wall Street White Shoe Boyz Club or the Republican/Democratic Mafia whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve robbed the people and the nation of its wealth. Nothing I have ever said or written has contributed to those developments.\n\nWe at the Trends Journal read and research extensively and our forecasts are based not on what we ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to see but, rather, on what we do see! Those who see things differently are welcome to their vision. Our oft-repeated motto is, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThink for Yourself.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSURVIVORS GUIDE\n\nAs both a trend forecaster and Close Combat martial artist, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThink for YourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is my key to both business success and personal survival. In the case of survival there is no better example than 9/11. \n\nAfter the first plane struck the North Tower of The World Trade Center, the message broadcast over the P.A. system to panicked workers in the South Tower by an anonymous voice of authority was, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGo back to your offices. The fire marshals said the fire in the North Tower is under control.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOf the 130 calls made to emergency operators from people in the Trade Center, only 2 callers were told to flee. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust sit tight. Just sit tight. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on the way,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the advice given to panic-stricken victims by panic-stricken operators.\n\nOur message advises you to put yourself in emergency mode. There are no set patterns, formulas or rule books to follow. More than likely, no one will be coming to the rescue: youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be on your own and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthink for yourself.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The 1st Great War of the 21st Century has begun. It could be set off in a single, definitive, Pearl Harbor moment or it could be a series of escalating violent events that lead to an undeclared, but global, state of war.\n\nGiven the western worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pro-war sentiments, the policy decisions of its politicians and the wide support from otherwise disparate right/left factions (German Greens, French New-Anti-Capitalists, British Labour and US neocons united with US liberals), peace is not a detectable trend.\n\nSincerely\n\nGerald Celente\n\nP.S. In this issue we welcome spectacular artistic contributions by Eugene Gregan and Anthony Freda. GreganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s subtle boldness, contrasted by FredaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bold subtlety provide a visual counterpart to the Gerald Celente/John Anthony West literary collaboration. The Trends Journal has evolved into a publication we regard as an embodiment of the Renaissance spirit.\n\n*For those who receive only the online edition, we suggest you consider upgrading your subscription to the full color, print magazine edition. This Spring issue is, and those to follow will be, unique historical documents featuring powerful, original supporting artwork. \nThe Trends Journal is worth archiving and preserving for future reference. When the future becomes the present, only the Trends Journal will provide readers with a blow-by-blow, event-by-event portrait of how it got that way. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f61c60a0319b6bdcc8d4f0c46dc670e635561d","amp;dn":"The+First+Great+War+of+the+21st+Century.+Prepare+Survive+Prevail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f61c60a0319b6bdcc8d4f0c46dc670e635561d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,246,28,96,160,49,155,107,220,200,212,240,196,109,198,112,230,53,86,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
