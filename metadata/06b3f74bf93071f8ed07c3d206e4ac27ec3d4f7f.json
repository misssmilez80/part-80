A veteran of cyberporn investigations, Australian cop Philip Jackson is no stranger to the dangerous side of sexual fetishes. He may have found his sickest case yet when he discovers a sinister side to an American website devoted to fat-admiring men and obese women called &quot;feeders&quot; and &quot;gainers.&quot; Could the man behind it all be force-feeding missing women to death?
