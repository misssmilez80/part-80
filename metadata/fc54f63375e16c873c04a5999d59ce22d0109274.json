Running just under 13 minutes, Ruination is a nervous, dark voyage through the yearning psyche of the composer, scored for violin, two cellos, and computer. Grathwohl's precisely-crafted atmospheres and psychedelically inspired string scores create a miraculously tense and suspenseful listening experience, which are sure to compliment the tastes of those who enjoy the works of Tim Hecker and Fennesz.\n\nTracklisting:\n01. The Return to Circular Consciousness\n02. Hedon Branch\n03. Drunken Dystopia\n04.
