When they find themselves on either side of an all-out corporate war, they discover the toughest part of the job is deciding how much to trust the one you love.\n\nCIA officer Claire Stenwick (Roberts) and MI6 agent Ray Koval (Owen) have left the world of government intelligence to cash in on the highly profitable cold war raging between two rival multinational corporations. Their mission? Secure the formula for a product that will bring a fortune to the company that patents it first.\n\nFor their employers--industry titan Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) and buccaneer CEO Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti)--nothing is out of bounds. When the stakes rise, no one knows who is playing whom, and the trickiest secret for Claire and Ray becomes their growing attraction. As they each try to stay one double-cross ahead, two career loners find their schemes endangered by the only thing they can't cheat their way out of: love.\n\nYear: 2009\n\nCast: Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Tom Wilkinson, Paul Giamatti, Dan Daily...\n\nDuration: 125 minutes\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nFormat: DVD 5\n\nScreen: 16:9\n\nStandard: NTSC\n\nAudio: English (Dolby Digital 5.1 )\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish &amp; Portuguese\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ad8b65cce9ebe60611e5a33e09f0b70537654a9","amp;dn":"Duplicity+%282009%29+%28NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ad8b65cce9ebe60611e5a33e09f0b70537654a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,216,182,92,206,158,190,96,97,30,90,51,224,159,11,112,83,118,84,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
