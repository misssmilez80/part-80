Their soulful blend and style with lyrics like, &quot;I never made it on my own and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never make it all alone,&quot; lives with you long after you first hear them and serves to show that this band is all about connecting with their audience. The Hammer up front and on point leading the way, Eric King's swirling blues guitar, John Gies' punctuating bass lines and Texas Jack's precision, pounding 'n percolating create a viceral soundscape that keeps their ever-expanding fan base coming back for more. The Gypsy Sons just released their new 15 song CD, &quot;Walking On The Water,&quot; in April of 2009. Head to iTunes and CD Baby for Gypsy Sons ringtones and digital downloads and be sure to catch them live, in the bars, while you still can. \n\nTHE HAMMER - has had numerous successes with his different bands. He's been signed to major labels and has shared the stage with multi-platinum selling acts. This Virginia boy taps deep into his early childhood violin and saxophone training, to create the soulful guitar riffs and melodies that lay the groundwork for the foot stomping rockers and the sugary sweet ballads. The Hammer will rock the hell out of you and run a bubble bath for you afterwards. \n\nJOHN GIES - is a barrel o' monkeys, a tremendous vocalist, a superb songwriter and one helluva bass player. Oh and just for the record, Dr. Sexy says you have a fever and the only cure is more Gypsy Sons. Bass in your face. \n\nERIC KING - started on the local Washington D.C. music scene in the mid 90's.
