The song has sold 143,835 copies as of July, 8th 2009.\n\nJon Caramanica of New York Times gives a good review about &quot;Wanted&quot; and Jessie's songs: Here is what he thought: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWanted,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the debut single by the Georgia-raised, Nashville-based Jessie James, is feisty shampoo-commercial pop save for three bars near the bridge, when a country guitar shows its hand. If Nashville can go pop, why canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pop start out a little bit Nashville? ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what the music of Ms. James, whose self-titled debut (on Mercury) is due in July, is asking. And while weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re mixing, why canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it be hip-hop as well? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCowboy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ written with Jamey Johnson and Randy Houser, has snappy snares and puckish fiddle. The clever ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Jeans,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which uses a beat drawn from Ms. JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own step routine and tweaks Dem Franchise BoyzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 2004 hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite Tee,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is perhaps the first white-girl country-rap song. But Ms. James knows getting embraced by the home crowd would be nice too. To wit, the Twitter message she recently posted to the producer Mitch Allan, imploring him to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmake a country version of Wanted!!! Country stations want it!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But can she go home again? \n\nBillboard Review: Pull out all the sex appeal from Carrie Underwood in &quot;Before He Cheats,&quot; throw on a Pussycat Dolls beat and infuse some powerhouse Christina Aguilera vocals, and it's nearly Jessie James' &quot;Wanted.&quot;\n\nThe Nashville-based singer's first single has a forceful bang and a aslight Souther twang, tapping into Pink and Kelly Clarkson territory with its slamming rock vibe.\n\nMitch Allen (Daughtry, Faith Hill) constructed an alluring rock song with some parts country, some parts hip-hop. James crafted the track with a hot pop/rock team of songwriters: Allan, Kara DioGuardio and David Hodges; paired with her convincing vocals and swagger, she's got what it takes to make a name for herself. \n\nScott Vollweiler of Broken Records Magazine in their June/July Issue: Once you pop the album into your cd player, you will be amazed, this girl can really sing! While the album sent to us only have 5 tracks, each song was strong and well written. Jessie is truly a country girl singing her butt off. Her first single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWantedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was written by Mitch Allan, Kara DioGuardi, David Hodges and Jessie herself. When your writing with some of the best writers in the world, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no way you can strike out. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue JeansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was apart of the soundtrack for the movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConfessions of a Shopaholic.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Her songs have already passed the Four Million mark on myspace. She is poised to be next big thing.
