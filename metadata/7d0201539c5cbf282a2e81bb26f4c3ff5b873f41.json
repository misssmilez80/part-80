Eddie Turner, who plays lead guitar with iconoclastic bluesman Otis Taylor, has an album that turns equally to rock and funk as it does to blues. And on &quot;Sin,&quot; he simply turns in one of the most stunning pieces of gospel heard in years -- stripped-down, but with touches of hip-hop that offers a real way forward into the 21st century for the genre. &quot;Confusion Illusion&quot; is blues-funk -- quite a feat for a trio of guitar, bass, and drums (with some overdubbed keys), while &quot;Gangster of Love&quot; takes Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson's tune out for a Saturday night party. The thing is, Turner is equally adept wherever he turns his hand, whether it's the dark atmospherics of &quot;Secret&quot; or his remarkable cover of &quot;The Wind Cries Mary,&quot; which completely re-imagines the song, even as Turner does a nigh-on perfect Hendrix vocal impersonation. With this disc (and thanks to impressive production from bandmate Kenny Passarelli and some incredible drumwork from Mark Clark) Turner makes a very agile leap from sideman to exceptional frontman. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d0201539c5cbf282a2e81bb26f4c3ff5b873f41","amp;dn":"Eddie+Turner..Rise%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d0201539c5cbf282a2e81bb26f4c3ff5b873f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,2,1,83,156,92,191,40,42,46,129,187,38,244,195,255,91,135,63,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
